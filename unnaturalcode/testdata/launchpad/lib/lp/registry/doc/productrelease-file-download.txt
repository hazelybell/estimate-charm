ProductRelease File Download
============================

A ProductRelease can have files associated with it for one of two
reasons.  First, a code tarball can be associated to a ProductRelease
and it is used to create an associated branch.

In another use, a product owner can associate files with a
ProductRelease for direct download by Launchpad users.  These files
can be installers, executables, documentation, or README files.

A ProductSeries can have multiple releases.  Firefox 1.5 (a ProductSeries)
has ProductReleases 1.5.0.1 and 1.5.0.2

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.product import IProductSet

First, get a product that has some ProductSeries in the sample data.

    >>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> firefox = productset['firefox']

A ProductSeries can be retrieved using the associated product and the
series name.

    >>> trunk = firefox.getSeries('trunk')

Get the product releases for trunk.

    >>> releases = trunk.releases
    >>> releases.count()
    3

Find all product release files for trunk.

    >>> files = trunk.release_files
    >>> len(files)
    1

Pick the first release from the set.

    >>> rel = list(releases)[0]
    >>> files = rel.files
    >>> print files.count()
    1

Add a file alias to the productrelease.

    >>> from lp.services.webapp.interfaces import ILaunchBag

    >>> login("foo.bar@canonical.com")
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> from pytz import UTC
    >>> def add_release_file(release, file_content, name, description,
    ...                      date_uploaded=None):
    ...     user = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    ...     result = release.addReleaseFile(
    ...         filename=name,
    ...         file_content=StringIO(file_content),
    ...         content_type='test/plain',
    ...         uploader=user,
    ...         description=description)
    ...     if date_uploaded is not None:
    ...         removeSecurityProxy(result).date_uploaded = date_uploaded
    ...     return result
    >>> product_release_file = add_release_file(
    ...    rel, 'Some useful information.',
    ...    'foo.txt', 'Foo file')
    >>> print product_release_file.description
    Foo file

The number of files in the ProductRelease has increased.

    >>> print rel.files.count()
    2

The number of files on the series has increased

    >>> print len(trunk.release_files)
    2

The alias can be retrieved by name.

    >>> file_alias = rel.getFileAliasByName('foo.txt')
    >>> print file_alias.filename
    foo.txt

Attempting to retrieve an alias that does not exist is an error.

    >>> file_alias = rel.getFileAliasByName('bar.txt')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotFoundError: 'bar.txt'

The ProductReleaseFile can also be retrieved by name.

    >>> prf = rel.getProductReleaseFileByName('foo.txt')
    >>> print prf.libraryfile.filename
    foo.txt

Attempting to retrieve a ProductReleaseFile  that does not exist is an
error.

    >>> prf = rel.getProductReleaseFileByName('bar.txt')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotFoundError: 'bar.txt'

Deleting the release file results in the file count being reduced.
Only the product owner, product series owner, admins, or experts can
delete a product file.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> rel.files[0].destroySelf()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: (<ProductReleaseFile...>, 'destroySelf', 'launchpad.Edit')
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> for release_file in rel.files:
    ...     if release_file.libraryfile.id == file_alias.id:
    ...         release_file.destroySelf()
    ...         break
    >>> print rel.files.count()
    1

The deleted release file will no longer appear in ProductRelease.files.

    >>> release_file in rel.files
    False

Deleting files via a GET method is not allowed.

    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
    >>> from lp.services.webapp.servers import LaunchpadTestRequest
    >>> request = LaunchpadTestRequest(
    ...     environ={'REQUEST_METHOD': 'GET'},
    ...     form={'delete_files': 'Delete Files'})
    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')
    >>> view = getMultiAdapter((firefox,request), name='+download')
    >>> view.initialize()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    UnsafeFormGetSubmissionError: Delete Files

There a convenience method for getting all of the releases for a list
of series.  The releases are returned sorted by release date in
reverse order.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.productrelease import (
    ...     IProductReleaseSet)
    >>> series = firefox.series
    >>> release_set = getUtility(IProductReleaseSet)
    >>> releases = release_set.getReleasesForSeries(series)
    >>> for release in releases:
    ...     date = release.datereleased.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    ...     print release.version, date
    0.9.2 2004-10-15 18:32:35
    0.9.1 2004-10-15 18:31:19
    0.9 2004-10-15 18:27:09
    1.0.0 2004-06-28 00:00:00

There is also a convenience method for getting all of the files
associated with a list of releases.  The files are returned sorted by
the date each was uploaded in reverse order.

Let's add some release files to the releases for firefox.

    >>> from datetime import timedelta
    >>> now = datetime.now(UTC)
    >>> for i, release in enumerate(releases):
    ...     content = "Content %d" % i
    ...     name = "name%d" % i
    ...     description = "description%d" % i
    ...     upload_date = now + timedelta(days=i)
    ...     pr_file = add_release_file(
    ...         release, content, name,
    ...         description, date_uploaded=upload_date)

    >>> files = release_set.getFilesForReleases(releases)
    >>> for file in files:
    ...     print file.libraryfile.filename
    name3
    name2
    name1
    name0
    firefox_0.9.2.orig.tar.gz

Only the product owner can create a new release.

    >>> owner_email = firefox.owner.preferredemail.email
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> trunk.milestones[0].createProductRelease(firefox.owner, now)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: (<Milestone ...>, 'createProductRelease', 'launchpad.Edit')
    >>> login(owner_email)
    >>> milestone = trunk.newMilestone('8.0', code_name='ralph')
    >>> milestone.createProductRelease(firefox.owner, now,
    ...                                changelog='New in v2')
    <ProductRelease at ...>
    >>> for release in release_set.getReleasesForSeries(series):
    ...     print release.version
    8.0
    0.9.2
    0.9.1
    0.9
    1.0.0
