    <h1>Syncing software from a parent series</h1>

    <p>
      Syncing software from a parent series will take the package that's
      currently published in it, and upload it to the derived series without
      you having to use command line tools such as <em>dput</em> or 
      <em>ftp</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Syncing a package from the parent
      series will supersede any changes made in the derived version. If there
      are local changes you don't wish to lose, you will need to manually
      merge the changes into the upstream package and upload that to the
      derived series.
    </p>

    <h2>Checking the differences</h2>

    <p>
    Each row in the table shows a package that has different versions in
    the derived series and the parent(s).  Clicking the package name
    will expand the row to show more details about the package and allow 
    you to take some actions:
      <ul>
        <li>Add a comment about this package.</li>
        <li>Request debdiffs</li>
        <li>Ignoring this difference, or all differences for this package</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Adding comments</h3>
    <p>
    Click the green "Add comment" button and enter the comment inline.
    All previous comments are shown here also.
    </p>

    <h3>Requesting debdiffs</h3>
    <p>
    Click the "Compute differences from last common version".  A request is
    sent to the server to initiate the debdiff calculation.  While you wait
    for the calculation the icon will flash. The page will update
    automatically when the debdiff becomes available, giving you a link to
    download the debdiff file.
    </p>

    <h3>Ignoring differences</h3>
    <p>
    If you don't care about this package you have the option of setting it to
    <em>ignored</em>, which means that it will no longer appear in the list.   
    You can choose to ignore just "These versions", which means if a new 
    version is uploaded it will re-appear, or "All Versions" which means 
    you won't see it again unless you search explicitly for ignored 
    packages in the search criteria at the top of the page.
    </p>

    <h2>Requesting a sync</h2>
    <p>
    There are two methods of syncing:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A mass-sync:</strong>  This grabs all packages in all 
            parents that have a higher version and uploads them to the 
            derived series by clicking the mass-sync button at the bottom 
            of the page.  To do this you need to have archive administrator 
            permissions.</li>
        <li><strong>A selective sync:</strong>  You can check the box next 
            to each package and then click the sync button at the bottom of
            the page. To do this you need to have permissions to upload 
            each package.</li>
      </ul>
    After you request a sync the operation will complete in the background
    and the package(s) will flow into the distribution just like a normal 
    upload, including being held in the upload queue as appropriate.
