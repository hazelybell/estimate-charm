Hello %(user_displayname)s,

The commercial subscription for project '%(product_name)s' in
Launchpad will expire soon.
%(commercial_use_expiration)s

You can renew the commercial subscription which costs
US$250/year/project.  Follow the instructions presented on your
project overview page to purchase a subscription voucher.

A commercial subscription allows you to host your commercial project
on Launchpad in the same way as any other project. Project's with a
commercial subscription may have private-by-default bugs, and you
may also request the setup of private code hosting.

As the maintainer of a project with a commercial subscription, you
may create private teams with private mailing lists and private package
archives. Find out more about this here:
https://help.launchpad.net/CommercialHosting

If '%(product_name)s' possessed an Other/Proprietary licence at the time
of expiration, the project will be deactivated. Otherwise, the
commercial features will be deactivated. Things that are private will
remain private, but no one will be able to create new things that are
private.

Launchpad is a collaboration site, free to use for projects with an
approved open source licence.  When you registered your project, you'd
have seen a list of licences presented. These are the licences we
automatically recognise.

If you have a different licence to one on the approved list, it must
follow the guidelines we list on the following page in order to be
approved: https://help.launchpad.net/Legal/ProjectLicensing

Further information is on our FAQ "Can closed-source or proprietary
projects use Launchpad?" The link is here:

If the licence for your project needs to be corrected, you can do this
by following the 'Change Details' link on your project's overview page.

Thanks,

The Launchpad team.
