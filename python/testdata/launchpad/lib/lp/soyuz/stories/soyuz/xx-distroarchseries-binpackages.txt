DistroArchSeries Binary Package Pages
=====================================

In Launchpad, BinaryPackageReleases are directly attached to a
DistroArchSeries by a publication record (see
doc/publishedpackages.txt).

A DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackage, is a collection of
BinaryPackageReleases once published in a given DistroArchSeries.

SourcePackages are available through the web UI after traversing
through a DistroSeries and SourceName. The URL schema is:

$LP/ubuntu/$DISTRORELEASE/+source/$BINARYNAME

This specific page is not properly integrated in the navigation
system, so it's impossible to get there except by typing the entire
URL:

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty/i386/mozilla-firefox')

This page provides the publishing history of this BinaryPackage within
this architecture:

    >>> table = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'publishing-summary')
    >>> print extract_text(table)
    Date                  Status    Target     Pocket  Component Section  Priority  Phased updates  Version
    2006-04-11 13:00:01 UTC Published...Warty i386 release main     base Important                      1.0
    Published on 2006-04-11
    2005-06-18 00:00:00 UTC Published...Warty i386 release main     base     Extra                      0.9
    Published on 2005-06-18
    >>> print table.findAll("tr")[2].td["colspan"]
    10

It also provides a link to the currently published version:

    >>> browser.getLink("0.9").click()
    >>> print browser.title
    0.9 : mozilla-firefox : i386 : Warty (4.10) : Ubuntu

As well as a link to the related distribution source package:

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty/i386/mozilla-firefox')
    >>> browser.getLink(id="source_package").click()
    >>> print browser.title.decode('ascii', 'ignore')
    iceweasel package : Ubuntu

If the binary distribution does not have a current release, then the
link to the source package will not be present:

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/debian/woody/i386/pmount')
    >>> print browser.getLink(id="source_package")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

A BinaryPackageRelease once published in a DistroArchSeries is
represented by a DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease and easily
reached by traversing a DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackage instance with a
valid version, like:

$LP/ubuntu/$DISTRORELEASE/$ARCHTAG/$BINARYNAME/$VERSION

It's also reachable in a more natural way, starting from distribution page:

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu')

Then we get to the DistroSeries page:

    >>> browser.getLink(url='/ubuntu/warty').click()

Then the DistroArchSeries page:

    >>> browser.getLink(url='/ubuntu/warty/i386').click()

Now we are able to use the search box in this page:

    >>> browser.getControl(name="text").value = "moz"
    >>> browser.getControl("Search Packages").click()

Click on the wanted name to get on the DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease:

    >>> browser.getLink(url="mozilla-firefox/0.9").click()
    >>> print browser.title
    0.9 : mozilla-firefox : i386 : Warty (4.10) : Ubuntu

This page represents an IDistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease and is
able to point the user to the IDistroSeriesSourcePackageRelease which
originated itself:

    >>> source_element = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'source')
    >>> print extract_text(source_element)
    "mozilla-firefox" 0.9 source package in Ubuntu

    >>> print source_element.find(name='a')['href']
    /ubuntu/+source/mozilla-firefox/0.9

Also provide a section with the contained files, including the build,
the respective librarian URL and size:

    >>> files_element = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'files')
    >>> print extract_text(files_element)
    i386 build of mozilla-firefox 0.9 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    produced these files:
    mozilla-firefox_0.9_i386.deb (3 bytes)

    >>> dfiles_element = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     browser.contents, 'downloadable-files')
    >>> print dfiles_element.find(name='a')['href']
    http://.../40/mozilla-firefox_0.9_i386.deb

If the binary package did produce files, but those files have been
subsequently deleted, this will also be indicated and the file will
not be linked.

    First we need to get a handle on the right binary file.
    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet
    >>> warty = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']['warty']
    >>> firefox_build = warty.getBuildRecords(
    ...     name=u'mozilla-firefox', arch_tag='i386')[0]
    >>> firefox_deb = firefox_build.binarypackages[0].files[0]
    >>> print firefox_deb.libraryfile.filename
    mozilla-firefox_0.9_i386.deb

    Next we manually ensure that the file is deleted.
    >>> firefox_deb.libraryfile.deleted
    False
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(firefox_deb.libraryfile).content = None
    >>> firefox_deb.libraryfile.deleted
    True
    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> logout()

Now reload the page to see the deleted file without the link.

    >>> browser.reload()
    >>> files_element = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'files')
    >>> print extract_text(files_element)
    i386 build of mozilla-firefox 0.9 in ubuntu warty RELEASE
    produced these files:
    mozilla-firefox_0.9_i386.deb (deleted)

    >>> dfiles_element = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     browser.contents, 'downloadable-files')
    >>> print dfiles_element.find(name='a')
    None

Binary Packages with no files to present results in a clear statement
intead of a empty section.

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/hoary/i386/pmount/0.1-1')
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'files'))
    i386 build of pmount 0.1-1 in ubuntu hoary RELEASE
    produced no files for this binary package.

DistroArchSeries Partner Binary Package Pages
=============================================

Binary partner packages in Launchpad differ from regular packages by
two things:

1. Their component is 'partner'
2. Their archive is the partner archive, rather than the primary archive.

Their page functionality is identical to regular packages, which is described
in the previous section of this page.

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/breezy-autotest/i386/commercialpackage')

This page provides the publishing history of this BinaryPackage within
this architecture:

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'publishing-summary'))
    Date                  Status    Target     Pocket  Component Section Priority  Phased updates  Version

    Published on 2007-08-09

It also provides a link to the currently published version:

    >>> browser.getLink("1.0-1").click()
    >>> print browser.title
    1.0-1 : commercialpackage : i386 : Breezy Badger Autotest (6.6.6) : Ubuntu

A BinaryPackageRelease once published in a DistroArchSeries is
represented by a DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease and easily
reached by traversing a DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackage instance with a
valid version, like:

$LP/ubuntu/$DISTRORELEASE/$ARCHTAG/$BINARYNAME/$VERSION

It's also reachable in a more natural way, starting from distribution page:

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu')

Then we get to the DistroSeries page:

    >>> browser.getLink('All series').click()
    >>> browser.getLink('Breezy Badger Autotest').click()

Then the DistroArchSeries page:

    >>> browser.getLink('i386').click()

Now we are able to use the search box in this page:

    >>> browser.getControl(name="text").value = "commercialpackage"
    >>> browser.getControl("Search Packages").click()

Click on the wanted name to get on the DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease:

    >>> browser.getLink("commercialpackage").click()
    >>> print browser.title
    1.0-1 : commercialpackage : i386 : Breezy Badger Autotest (6.6.6) : Ubuntu

This page represents an IDistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease and is
able to point the user to the IDistroSeriesSourcePackageRelease which
originated itself:

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'source'))
    "commercialpackage" 1.0-1 source package in Ubuntu

Also provide a section with the contained files, including respective
librarian URL and size:

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'files'))
    i386 build of commercialpackage 1.0-1 in ubuntu breezy-autotest RELEASE
    produced these files:
    commercialpackage_1.0-1_i386.deb (652 bytes)


Tracing copied binary
=====================

Any user can view the publishing history details for a binary in the
distribution PRIMARY archive, specifically in the
DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackage page. It offers enough information to
trace copied binaries

If the publishing is a copy, the original location, distribution,
distroseries and archive are shown.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/ubuntu/warty/i386/pmount')

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...    find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'publishing-summary'))
