= Changing from a hosted ML to an external address =

Once made active, hosted mailing lists have their posting address stored in
the EmailAddress table.  These are not deleted when a team's contact address
is changed from a hosted ML to an external address, in order to ensure that
the address is reserved for the team which owns the ML.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> team, mailing_list = factory.makeTeamAndMailingList(
    ...     'aardvarks', 'no-priv')
    >>> transaction.commit()

    >>> from lp.services.identity.model.emailaddress import EmailAddressSet
    >>> email_set = EmailAddressSet()
    >>> email_set.getByEmail(mailing_list.address)
    <EmailAddress at...

The team owner sets the contact address to the hosted mailing list.

    >>> from lp.testing.pages import strip_label

    >>> logout()
    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~aardvarks/+edit')
    >>> user_browser.getLink(url='+contactaddress').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl('The Launchpad mailing list').selected = True
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Change').click()
    >>> user_browser.getLink(url="+contactaddress").click()
    >>> control = user_browser.getControl(name='field.contact_method')
    >>> [strip_label(label) for label in control.displayValue]
    ['The Launchpad mailing list for this team...]

The team owner sets the contact address to an external email address, and
Launchpad sends that address a confirmation message.

    >>> from lp.services.mail import stub
    >>> stub.test_emails = []
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Another e-mail address').selected = True
    >>> user_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.contact_address').value = 'bar@example.com'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Change').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Aardvarks in Launchpad
    >>> print_feedback_messages(user_browser.contents)
    A confirmation message has been sent to...
    >>> from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg = stub.test_emails.pop()
    >>> stub.test_emails
    []
    >>> import email
    >>> msg = email.message_from_string(raw_msg)
    >>> print msg['From']
    Launchpad Email Validator <noreply@launchpad.net>
    >>> print msg['Subject']
    Launchpad: Validate your team's contact email address

When the confirmation token url is followed, the external email address is
confirmed.

    >>> from lp.services.verification.tests.logintoken import (
    ...     get_token_url_from_email)
    >>> token_url = get_token_url_from_email(raw_msg)
    >>> user_browser.open(token_url)
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Confirm e-mail address
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Continue').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Aardvarks in Launchpad
    >>> print_feedback_messages(user_browser.contents)
    Email address successfully confirmed.

    >>> user_browser.getLink(url="+contactaddress").click()
    >>> control = user_browser.getControl(name='field.contact_method')
    >>> [strip_label(label) for label in control.displayValue]
    ['Another e-mail address']

The web UI will only display the team's contact address, but the
EmailAddress object for that team's mailing list will still be in the
database.

    >>> email_set.getByEmail(mailing_list.address)
    <EmailAddress at...
