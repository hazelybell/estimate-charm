Sample data
===========

There are two sorts of sample data. One used by developers when playing around
in http://launchpad.dev and another used by our tests.

The sample data used by default in http://launchpad.dev is stored as a SQL
file called current-dev.sql, in this same directory. That data is loaded into
the launchpad_dev DB and you can change it as you like, as its main purpose is
to aid developers experimenting all features of Launchpad.

Sample data for tests is stored as a SQL file called current.sql, under this
same directory. This data is loaded into the launchpad_ftest_template and
launchpad_ftest_playground DBs. The former is used by our test runner and the
latter can be accessed through http://launchpad.dev when you run the web app
using the test-playground config (i.e. make LPCONFIG=test-playground run),
so that you can see the world as one of our tests would.


Changing sample data
--------------------

For non trivial modifications, it is best if you store your sample
data modifications as a .sql script of INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements.
This is so when you want to commit your changes it is a simple case
of building a fresh batch of sample data, running your script, and
making a fresh sampledata snapshot. This ensures that only the changes you
want to make are made, as well as saving you time if somebody else updates
the sample data while you are working.

To update the sample data:

    1.  Go to the db schema directory:

            cd database/schema

    2.  Make a database with the current sample data:

            make

    3a. Connect to the db, and then do any INSERT or UPDATE commands you need:

            psql -d launchpad_dev -f my_sample_data_mods.sql

        If, for any reason, you want to change the sample data used for tests,
        you should replace launchpad_dev with launchpad_ftest_playground on
        the line above.

        If there are errors, fix and start again.

    3b. Alternatively, use 'make harness' to connect to the database and use
        any APIs you need:

            make harness

        Or:

            make harness LPCONFIG=test-playground

    4.  Update the snapshot of the sample data in current(-dev).sql:

            make newsampledata

    5.  Inspect the new sample data:

            bzr diff ../sampledata

    6.  Ensure the tests still pass:

            cd ../..
            make check  # Yeah, yeah, we all know our machines can stand that.

    7.  Commit your changes and submit for review:

            bzr commit -m 'Added frotz to sampledata..."
            bzr push
            bzr review-submit ...
