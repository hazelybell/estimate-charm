= Filebug Data Parser =

An application like Apport can upload data to Launchpad, and have the
information added to the bug report that the user will file. The
information is uploaded as a MIME multipart message, where the different
headers tells Launchpad what kind of information it is.


== FileBugDataParser Internals ==

FileBugDataParser is used to parse the MIME message with the information
to be added to the bug report. The information is passed as a file
object to the constructor.

    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> from lp.bugs.utilities.filebugdataparser import FileBugDataParser
    >>> parser = FileBugDataParser(StringIO('123456789'))

To make parsing easier and more efficient, it has a buffer where it
stores the next few bytes of the file. To begin with, it's empty.

    >>> parser._buffer
    ''

Whenever it needs to read some bytes of the file, it will read a fixed
number of bytes into the buffer. The number of bytes is specified by the
BUFFER_SIZE variable.

    >>> parser.BUFFER_SIZE = 3

There is helper method, _consumeBytes(), which will read from the file
until a certain delimiter string is encountered.

    >>> parser._consumeBytes('4')
    '1234'

In order to find the delimiter string, it had to read '123456' into
the buffer. Up to the delimiter string is read, but the rest of the
string is kept in the buffer.

    >>> parser._buffer
    '56'

The delimiter string isn't limited to one character.

    >>> parser._consumeBytes('67')
    '567'

    >>> parser._buffer
    '89'

If the delimiter isn't found in the file, the rest of the file is
returned.

    >>> parser._consumeBytes('0')
    '89'
    >>> parser._buffer
    ''

Subsequent reads will result in the empty string.

    >>> parser._consumeBytes('0')
    ''
    >>> parser._consumeBytes('0')
    ''


=== readLine() ===

readLine() is a helper method to read a single line of the file.

    >>> parser = FileBugDataParser(StringIO('123\n456\n789'))
    >>> parser.readLine()
    '123\n'
    >>> parser.readLine()
    '456\n'
    >>> parser.readLine()
    '789'

If we try to read past the end of the file an AssertionError will be
raised. This is to ensure that invalid messages won't cause an infinite
loop, or something like that.

    >>> parser.readLine()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: End of file reached.


=== readHeaders() ====

readHeaders() reads the headers of a MIME message. It reads all the
headers, untils it sees a blank line.

    >>> msg = """Header: value
    ... Space-Folded-Header: this header
    ...  is folded with a space.
    ... Tab-Folded-Header: this header
    ... \tis folded with a tab.
    ... Another-header: another-value
    ...
    ... Not-A-Header: not-a-value
    ... """
    >>> parser = FileBugDataParser(StringIO(msg))
    >>> headers = parser.readHeaders()
    >>> headers['Header']
    'value'
    >>> headers['Space-Folded-Header']
    'this header\n is folded with a space.'
    >>> headers['Tab-Folded-Header']
    'this header\n\tis folded with a tab.'
    >>> headers['Another-Header']
    'another-value'
    >>> 'Not-A-Header' in headers
    False


== Parsing the data ==

The parse() method returns a FileBugData object, with the information
from the message as attributes.


=== Headers ===

The headers are processed by the _setDataFromHeaders() method. It
accepts a FileBugData object and a dictionary of the headers.


==== Subject ====

The Subject header is available in the initial_summary attribute.

    >>> from lp.bugs.browser.bugtarget import FileBugData
    >>> data = FileBugData()
    >>> parser = FileBugDataParser(None)
    >>> parser._setDataFromHeaders(data, {'Subject': 'Bug Subject'})
    >>> data.initial_summary
    u'Bug Subject'


==== Tags ====

The Tags headers is translated into a list of strings as the
initial_tags attributes. The tags are translated to lower case
automatically.

    >>> data = FileBugData()
    >>> parser._setDataFromHeaders(data, {'Tags': 'Tag-One Tag-Two'})
    >>> sorted(data.initial_tags)
    [u'tag-one', u'tag-two']


==== Private ====

The Private header gets translated into a boolean, as the private
attribute. The values "yes" and "no" are accepted, which get translated
into True and False.

    >>> data = FileBugData()
    >>> parser._setDataFromHeaders(data, {'Private': 'yes'})
    >>> data.private
    True
    >>> data = FileBugData()
    >>> parser._setDataFromHeaders(data, {'Private': 'no'})
    >>> data.private
    False

We're in no position of presenting a good error message to the user at
this point, so invalid values get ignored.

    >>> data = FileBugData()
    >>> parser._setDataFromHeaders(data, {'Private': 'not-valid'})
    >>> print data.private
    None


==== Subscribers ====

The Subscribers header is turned into a list of strings, available
through the subscribers attribute. The strings get lowercased
automatically.

    >>> data = FileBugData()
    >>> parser._setDataFromHeaders(data, {'Subscribers': 'sub-one SUB-TWO'})
    >>> sorted(data.subscribers)
    [u'sub-one', u'sub-two']


==== HWDB submission keys ====

The HWDB-Submission key is turned into a list of strings, available
through the hwdb_submission_keys attribute.

    >>> data = FileBugData()
    >>> parser._setDataFromHeaders(
    ...     data, {'HWDB-Submission': 'submission-one'})
    >>> list(data.hwdb_submission_keys)
    [u'submission-one']

Two or more submission keys may be specified, separated by a comma,
optionally followed by space characters.

    >>> data = FileBugData()
    >>> parser._setDataFromHeaders(
    ...     data,
    ...     {'HWDB-Submission': ' submission-one, two\t,three ,  \nfour  '})
    >>> data.hwdb_submission_keys
    [u'four', u'submission-one', u'three', u'two']


=== Message Parts ===

Different parts of the message gets treated differently. In short, we
look at the Content-Disposition header. If it's inline, it's a comment,
if it's attachment, it's an attachment.


==== Inline parts ====

The first inline part is special. Instead of being treated as a comment,
it gets appended to the bug description. It's available through the
extra_description attribute.

    >>> used_parsers = []
    >>> def parse_message(message):
    ...     parser = FileBugDataParser(StringIO(message))
    ...     used_parsers.append(parser)
    ...     return parser.parse()

    >>> debug_data = """MIME-Version: 1.0
    ... Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=boundary
    ...
    ... --boundary
    ... Content-disposition: inline
    ... Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    ...
    ... This should be added to the description.
    ...
    ... Another line.
    ...
    ... --boundary--
    ... """
    >>> data = parse_message(debug_data)
    >>> data.extra_description
    u'This should be added to the description.\n\nAnother line.'


The text can also be base64 decoded.

    >>> encoded_text = """VGhpcyBzaG91bGQgYmUgYWRkZWQgdG8g
    ... dGhlIGRlc2NyaXB0aW9uLgoKQW5vdGhl
    ... ciBsaW5lLg=="""
    >>> encoded_text.decode('base64')
    'This should be added to the description.\n\nAnother line.'

    >>> debug_data = """MIME-Version: 1.0
    ... Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=boundary
    ...
    ... --boundary
    ... Content-disposition: inline
    ... Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    ... Content-transfer-encoding: base64
    ...
    ... %s
    ...
    ... --boundary--
    ... """ % encoded_text
    >>> data = parse_message(debug_data)
    >>> data.extra_description
    u'This should be added to the description.\n\nAnother line.'


==== Other inline parts ====

If there are more than one inline part, those will be added as comments
to the bug. The comments are simple ext strings, accessible through the
comments attribute.

    >>> debug_data = """MIME-Version: 1.0
    ... Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=boundary
    ...
    ... --boundary
    ... Content-disposition: inline
    ... Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    ...
    ... This should be added to the description.
    ...
    ... --boundary
    ... Content-disposition: inline
    ... Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    ...
    ... This should be added as a comment.
    ...
    ... --boundary
    ... Content-disposition: inline
    ... Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    ...
    ... This should be added as another comment.
    ...
    ... Line 2.
    ...
    ... --boundary--
    ... """
    >>> data = parse_message(debug_data)
    >>> len(data.comments)
    2
    >>> data.comments[0]
    u'This should be added as a comment.'
    >>> data.comments[1]
    u'This should be added as another comment.\n\nLine 2.'


=== Attachment parts ===

All the parts that have a 'Content-disposition: attachment' header
will get added as attachments to the bug. The attachment description can
be specified using a Content-description header, but it's not required.

    >>> debug_data = """MIME-Version: 1.0
    ... Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=boundary
    ...
    ... --boundary
    ... Content-disposition: attachment; filename='attachment1'
    ... Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    ...
    ... This is an attachment.
    ...
    ... Another line.
    ...
    ... --boundary
    ... Content-disposition: attachment; filename='attachment2'
    ... Content-description: Attachment description.
    ... Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
    ...
    ... This is another attachment, with a description.
    ... --boundary--
    ... """
    >>> data = parse_message(debug_data)
    >>> len(data.attachments)
    2
    >>> first_attachment, second_attachment = data.attachments

The filename is copied into the 'filename' item.

    >>> first_attachment['filename']
    u'attachment1'
    >>> second_attachment['filename']
    u'attachment2'

The Content-Type header is copied as is.

    >>> first_attachment['content_type']
    u'text/plain; charset=utf-8'
    >>> second_attachment['content_type']
    u'text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1'

If there is a Content-Description header, it's accessible as
'description'.

    >>> second_attachment['description']
    u'Attachment description.'

If there isn't any Content-Description header, the file name is used
instead.

    >>> first_attachment['description']
    u'attachment1'

The contents of the attachments are stored in a file.

    >>> first_file = first_attachment['content']
    >>> first_file.read()
    'This is an attachment.\n\nAnother line.\n\n'
    >>> first_file.close()

    >>> second_file = second_attachment['content']
    >>> second_file.read()
    'This is another attachment, with a description.\n'
    >>> second_file.close()

Binary files are base64 encoded. They are decoded automatically.

    >>> binary_data = '\n'.join(['\x00'*5, '\x01'*5])
    >>> debug_data = """MIME-Version: 1.0
    ... Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=boundary
    ...
    ... --boundary
    ... Content-disposition: attachment; filename='attachment1'
    ... Content-type: application/octet-stream
    ... Content-transfer-encoding: base64
    ...
    ... %s
    ... --boundary--
    ... """ % binary_data.encode('base64')
    >>> data = parse_message(debug_data)
    >>> len(data.attachments)
    1

    >>> contents = data.attachments[0]['content']
    >>> contents.read()
    '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\n\x01\x01\x01\x01\x01'
    >>> contents.close()


== Invalid messages ==

If someone gives an invalid message, for example one that doesn't have
an end boundary, and AssertionError will be raised. This is mainly to
assert that nothing bad will happen if we can't parse the message. We
don't care about giving the user a good error message, since the format
is well-known.

    >>> debug_data = """MIME-Version: 1.0
    ... Content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=boundary
    ...
    ... --boundary
    ... Content-disposition: attachment; filename='attachment1'
    ... Content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
    ...
    ... This is an attachment.
    ...
    ... Another line."""
    >>> data = parse_message(debug_data)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: End of file reached.
