= Translation Export Request Queue =

The queue of export requests is served by a cron script. Let's check if it can
serve those requests properly.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.poexportrequest import (
    ...     IPOExportRequestSet)
    >>> from lp.translations.utilities.tests.helpers import (
    ...     is_valid_mofile)
    >>> from lp.testing.mail_helpers import pop_notifications, print_emails

This is a dummy logger class to capture the export's log messages.

    >>> import sys

Here's somebody to make a request.

    >>> person = factory.makePerson(
    ...     email='downloader@example.com',
    ...     name='downloader',
    ...     displayname='Happy Downloader')

== Requesting PO files ==

Our user requests the Catalan and Czech translations of a template.

    >>> from lp.translations.model.potemplate import POTemplate
    >>> potemplate = POTemplate.get(2)
    >>> ca = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('ca')
    >>> cs = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('cs')

    >>> request_set = getUtility(IPOExportRequestSet)
    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca, cs])

Now we request that the queue be processed.

(Commits are needed to make the test requests seep through to the slave
database).

    >>> import transaction
    >>> from lp.translations.scripts.po_export_queue import process_queue
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> from lp.services.log.logger import FakeLogger
    >>> process_queue(transaction, FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Exporting objects for Happy Downloader, related to template pmount
    in Ubuntu Hoary package "pmount"
    INFO Stored file at http://.../launchpad-export.tar.gz

The user receives a confirmation email.

    >>> emails = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(emails)
    1
    >>> print_emails(notifications=emails)
    From: ...
    To: downloader@example.com
    Subject: Launchpad translation download: Ubuntu Hoary pmount -
    pmount template
    Hello Happy Downloader,
    <BLANKLINE>
    The translation files you requested from Launchpad are ready for
    download from the following location:
    <BLANKLINE>
      http://.../launchpad-export.tar.gz
    <BLANKLINE>
    Note: this link will expire in about 1 week.  If you want to
    download these translations again, you will have to request
    them again at
    <BLANKLINE>
      http://translations.launchpad.../hoary/+source/pmount/+pots/p...
    <BLANKLINE>
    -- =
    Automatic message from Launchpad.net.
    ----------------------------------------

The email contains a URL linking to where the exported file can be downloaded.

    >>> import re

    >>> def extract_url(text):
    ...     urls = re.compile(r'^ *(http://.*)$', re.M).findall(text)
    ...     return urls[0]

    >>> body = emails.pop().get_payload()
    >>> url = extract_url(body)

Let's download it and make sure the contents look ok.

    >>> import urllib2
    >>> from lp.services.helpers import string_to_tarfile
    >>> tarball = string_to_tarfile(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
    >>> for name in sorted(tarball.getnames()):
    ...     # XXX: 2010-04-26, Salgado, bug=570244: The .rstrip('/') is to
    ...     # make this pass on python2.5 and 2.6.
    ...     print name.rstrip('/')
    pmount
    pmount/pmount-ca.po
    pmount/pmount-cs.po


== Duplicate requests ==

On another occasion, the user requests just Catalan translation.  The
queue is initially empty.

    >>> def render_request(request):
    ...     if request.pofile is None:
    ...         return request.potemplate.name
    ...     else:
    ...         return "%s:%s" % (request.potemplate.name,
    ...                           request.pofile.language.code)
    >>> from lp.translations.model.poexportrequest import (
    ...     POExportRequest)
    >>> def print_queue():
    ...     requests = [
    ...         render_request(request)
    ...         for request in POExportRequest.select()]
    ...     for request in sorted(requests):
    ...         print request
    >>> print_queue()

    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca])

The request is on the queue, as you'd expect.

    >>> print_queue()
    pmount:ca

The same user now makes a separate, new request for the Catalan and
Czech translations.

    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca, cs])

Since the request for the Catalan translation is a duplicate, only the
Czech one is added to the export queue.

    >>> print_queue()
    pmount:ca
    pmount:cs

The user also requests the template again.

    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, potemplate)
    >>> print_queue()
    pmount
    pmount:ca
    pmount:cs

The user now requests all of these files again, as well as the Spanish
translation.

    >>> es = potemplate.getPOFileByLang('es')
    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, potemplate, [ca, cs, es])

Most of this request consists of duplications, and those are ignored.
Only the Spanish request is new, and that goes into the queue.

    >>> print_queue()
    pmount
    pmount:ca
    pmount:cs
    pmount:es

    >>> # Clean up the queue again.
    >>> for request in POExportRequest.select():
    ...     request.destroySelf()


== Requesting MO files ==

Let's try requesting an export in MO format:

    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.translationfileformat import (
    ...     TranslationFileFormat)
    >>> request_set.addRequest(
    ...     person, None, [cs, cs.potemplate], TranslationFileFormat.MO)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> process_queue(transaction, FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Exporting objects for Happy Downloader, related to template pmount
    in Ubuntu Hoary package "pmount"
    INFO Stored file at http://.../cs_LC_MESSAGES_pmount.mo

    >>> emails = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(emails)
    1
    >>> print_emails(notifications=emails)
    From: ...
    To: downloader@example.com
    Subject: Launchpad translation download: Ubuntu Hoary pmount - Czech
    translation of pmount
    Hello Happy Downloader,
    <BLANKLINE>
    The translation files you requested from Launchpad are ready for
    download from the following location:
    <BLANKLINE>
      http://.../cs_LC_MESSAGES_pmount.mo
    <BLANKLINE>
    Note: this link will expire in about 1 week.  If you want to
    download these translations again, you will have to request
    them again at
    <BLANKLINE>
      http://translations.launchpad.../pmount/+pots/pmoun=
    t/cs/+export
    <BLANKLINE>
    -- =
    Automatic message from Launchpad.net.
    ----------------------------------------

Check whether we generated a good .mo file.

    >>> body = emails.pop().get_payload()
    >>> url = extract_url(body)
    >>> is_valid_mofile(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
    True


== Cron script ==

Finally, the code should work when executed from the script. This is a good
way that the user used by the script has the needed rights to use the
database.

The queue can contain requests for translations from both distributions and
products.  Each request may request a template, or a list of templates, or
just PO files.

    # We need to request again some files.
    >>> ca.potemplate.distroseries is None
    False
    >>> cs.potemplate.distroseries is None
    False
    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, None, [ca, cs])
    >>> product_template = potemplate.get(1)
    >>> product_template.productseries is None
    False
    >>> request_set.addRequest(person, product_template)
    >>> alsa_template = POTemplate.selectOneBy(path='po/alsa-utils.pot')
    >>> alsa_es = alsa_template.getPOFileByLang('es')
    >>> netapplet_template = POTemplate.selectOneBy(path='po/netapplet.pot')
    >>> request_set.addRequest(
    ...     person, [alsa_template, netapplet_template], [alsa_es])
    >>> transaction.commit()

The script is run.

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> process = subprocess.Popen([
    ...     sys.executable, 'cronscripts/rosetta-export-queue.py', '-v'
    ...     ], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stderr=subprocess.STDOUT
    ...     )
    >>> (output, empty) = process.communicate()
    >>> print output
