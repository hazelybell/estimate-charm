Locations for People and Teams
==============================

We no longer allow people to set their geographical locations, but their time
zone (which they can set) is stored together with their latitude/longitude (in
PersonLocation). Until we move the time zone back to the Person table
(bug=933699), we'll maintain the setLocation() API on IPerson.

    >>> from lp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)

    >>> marilize = personset.getByName('marilize')
    >>> print marilize.time_zone
    Africa/Maseru
    >>> print marilize.latitude
    None
    >>> print marilize.longitude
    None

setLocation() will always set the time zone to the given value and both
latitude and longitude to None, regardless of what was passed in.

    >>> cprov = personset.getByName('cprov')
    >>> ignored = login_person(cprov)
    >>> cprov.setLocation(-43.2, -61.93, 'America/Sao_Paulo', cprov)
    >>> print cprov.time_zone
    America/Sao_Paulo
    >>> print cprov.latitude
    None
    >>> print cprov.longitude
    None

We cannot store a location for a team, though.

    >>> jdub = personset.getByName('jdub')
    >>> guadamen = personset.getByName('guadamen')
    >>> guadamen.setLocation(34.5, 23.1, 'Africa/Maseru', jdub)
