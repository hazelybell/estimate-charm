POTemplateSet
=============

Test that the security setup for IPOTemplateSet is working

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.potemplate import IPOTemplateSet
    >>> potemplate_set = getUtility(IPOTemplateSet)


getAllByName
------------

This method will return all IPOTemplate that have a given name.

    >>> evolution_templates = potemplate_set.getAllByName('evolution-2.2')
    >>> titles = [potemplate.title
    ...              for potemplate in evolution_templates
    ...             ]
    >>> ('Template "evolution-2.2" in Ubuntu Hoary package "evolution"'
    ...     in titles)
    True

    >>> 'Template "evolution-2.2" in Evolution trunk' in titles
    True


getAllOrderByDateLastUpdated
----------------------------

This method will give us all available IPOTemplate sorted by their
modification date.

    >>> templates = list(potemplate_set.getAllOrderByDateLastUpdated())
    >>> len(templates)
    10

    >>> templates[0].date_last_updated >= templates[5].date_last_updated
    True

    >>> templates[1].date_last_updated >= templates[5].date_last_updated
    True

    >>> templates[2].date_last_updated >= templates[5].date_last_updated
    True

    >>> templates[3].date_last_updated >= templates[5].date_last_updated
    True

    >>> templates[4].date_last_updated >= templates[5].date_last_updated
    True

= POTemplateSubset=

A POTemplateSubset describes the subset of all templates that belong to
either one product series, or one source package in one distro series.


new
---

When we create a template, it is initialized with a default header.

    >>> from lp.registry.model.product import ProductSet
    >>> alsa_product = ProductSet().getByName('alsa-utils')
    >>> alsa_trunk = alsa_product.getSeries('trunk')
    >>> alsa_subset = potemplate_set.getSubset(productseries=alsa_trunk)
    >>> from lp.registry.model.person import PersonSet
    >>> user = PersonSet().getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> new_template = alsa_subset.new(
    ...        'testtemplate', 'testing', 'po/testing.pot', user)

    >>> print new_template.header
    Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION
    Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: FULL NAME <EMAIL@ADDRESS>
    POT-Creation-Date: ...
    PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE
    Last-Translator: FULL NAME <EMAIL@ADDRESS>
    Language-Team: LANGUAGE <LL@li.org>
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
    Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit


getPOTemplateByName
-------------------

This method gives us the IPOTemplate that belongs to this subset and its
name is the given one.

    >>> from lp.registry.model.productseries import ProductSeries
    >>> productseries = ProductSeries.get(3)
    >>> potemplatesubset = potemplate_set.getSubset(
    ...        productseries=productseries)

    >>> potemplate = potemplatesubset.getPOTemplateByName(
    ...        'evolution-2.2')
    >>> print potemplate.title
    Template "evolution-2.2" in Evolution trunk


getPOTemplateByPath
-------------------

This method gives us the IPOTemplate that belongs to this subset and its
path in the source code is the given one.

    >>> potemplate = potemplatesubset.getPOTemplateByPath(
    ...        'po/evolution-2.2-test.pot')
    >>> print potemplate.title
    Template "evolution-2.2-test" in Evolution trunk


getAllOrderByDateLastUpdated
----------------------------

This method will give us all available IPOTemplate for this subset
sorted by their modification date.

    >>> templates = list(potemplatesubset.getAllOrderByDateLastUpdated())
    >>> len(templates)
    2

    >>> templates[0].date_last_updated >= templates[1].date_last_updated
    True


getClosestPOTemplate
--------------------

With this method, we get the IPOTemplate from this Subset that has the
bigger part of the path in common.

To do this test, first we check the evolution product, it has two
potemplates in the same path and thus, this method should not get any
value.

    >>> productseries = ProductSeries.get(3)
    >>> potemplatesubset = potemplate_set.getSubset(
    ...        productseries=productseries)

    >>> for template in potemplatesubset:
    ...       print template.path
    po/evolution-2.2.pot
    po/evolution-2.2-test.pot

    >>> potemplatesubset.getClosestPOTemplate('po') is None
    True

Now, we move to the NetApplet product, we should detect it.

    >>> productseries = ProductSeries.get(5)
    >>> potemplatesubset = potemplate_set.getSubset(
    ...        productseries=productseries)

    >>> for template in potemplatesubset:
    ...       print template.path
    po/netapplet.pot

    >>> potemplatesubset.getClosestPOTemplate('po') is None
    False

But if we give the empty string or None, we get nothing

    >>> potemplatesubset.getClosestPOTemplate('') is None
    True

    >>> potemplatesubset.getClosestPOTemplate('') is None
    True


POTemplate
==========

POTemplate is an object with all strings that must be translated for a
concrete context.

    >>> from lp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.potemplate import IPOTemplate
    >>> from lp.translations.model.potemplate import POTemplate
    >>> potemplate = POTemplate.get(1)

It implements the IPOTemplate interface.

    >>> verifyObject(IPOTemplate, potemplate)
    True


getPOFileByPath
---------------

We can get an IPOFile inside a template based on its path.

    >>> pofile = potemplate.getPOFileByPath('es.po')
    >>> print pofile.title
    Spanish (es) translation of evolution-2.2 in Evolution trunk


getDummyPOFile
--------------

To get an IPOFile object even for languages which don't have a
translation of this template, we use the getDummyPOFile method, passing
in the language.

    >>> xx_language = factory.makeLanguage(
    ...        'xx@test', name='Test language')
    >>> xx_pofile = potemplate.getDummyPOFile(xx_language)
    >>> print xx_pofile.title
    Test language (xx@test) translation of evolution-2.2 in Evolution trunk


newPOFile
---------

The Portuguese translation has not been started yet; therefore, when we
call IPOTemplate.newPOFile() a POFile instance will be created.

    >>> pofile = potemplate.newPOFile('pt')

By default, we should get a path for this pofile, that has some
information about its potemplate's filename so we don't have conflicts
with other pofiles.

    >>> pofile.path
    u'po/evolution-2.2-pt.po'

Lets try to access untranslated entries here.

    >>> potmsgsets = list(pofile.getPOTMsgSetUntranslated())
    >>> len(potmsgsets) == potemplate.getPOTMsgSetsCount(current=True)
    True

And there shouldn't be any translated entries

    >>> potmsgsets = list(pofile.getPOTMsgSetTranslated())
    >>> len(potmsgsets)
    0


relatives_by_source
-------------------

This property gives us an iterator of IPOTemplate objects that are in
the same context IProductSeries or IDistroSeries/ISourcePackageName and
are 'current'.

First, we can see the relatives in a IProductSeries context.

    >>> for relative_potemplate in potemplate.relatives_by_source:
    ...        assert relative_potemplate.iscurrent
    ...        print relative_potemplate.title
    Template "evolution-2.2-test" in Evolution trunk

Let's get a new IPOTemplate that belongs to an IDistroSeries:

    >>> potemplate = POTemplate.get(4)
    >>> print potemplate.title
    Template "evolution-2.2" in Ubuntu Hoary package "evolution"

And this is the list of templates related with this one based on its
context:

    >>> for relative_potemplate in potemplate.relatives_by_source:
    ...        assert relative_potemplate.iscurrent
    ...        print relative_potemplate.title
    Template "man" in Ubuntu Hoary package "evolution"

But we can see that there is a third template in this context:

    >>> not_current_template = POTemplate.get(9)
    >>> not_current_template.productseries == potemplate.productseries
    True

    >>> not_current_template.distroseries == potemplate.distroseries
    True

    >>> not_current_template.sourcepackagename == potemplate.sourcepackagename
    True

And this is the explanation of not having it in previous lists, it's not
current.

    >>> not_current_template.iscurrent
    False


export()
--------

Templates can be exported to its native format.

    >>> for line in potemplate.export().split('\n'):
    ...        if 'X-Launchpad-Export-Date' in line:

exportWithTranslations()
------------------------

We can also get a template export that includes all translations inside.
The file format we will get depends on the default template file format.

In this case, we are going to see how a PO template is exported with
translations.

    >>> print potemplate.source_file_format.name
    PO

    >>> exported_translation_file = potemplate.exportWithTranslations()

PO file format doesn't have a native way to export template +
translations, instead, we get a tarball with all those files.

    >>> print exported_translation_file.content_type
    application/x-gtar

Inspecting the tarball content, we have the list of entries exported.
This includes the 'pt' POFile that was created earlier on the
'evolution' product as this is sharing translations with the source
package that this potemplate is from.

    >>> from lp.services.helpers import string_to_tarfile
    >>> tarfile_string = exported_translation_file.read()
    >>> tarfile = string_to_tarfile(tarfile_string)

    # XXX: 2010-04-26, Salgado, bug=570244: The .rstrip('/') is to make this
    # pass on python2.5 and 2.6.

    >>> sorted(name.rstrip('/') for name in tarfile.getnames())
    ['evolution-2.2', 'evolution-2.2/evolution-2.2-es.po',
     'evolution-2.2/evolution-2.2-ja.po', 'evolution-2.2/evolution-2.2-xh.po',
     'po', 'po/evolution-2.2-pt.po', 'po/evolution-2.2.pot']

The *-es.po file is indeed the Spanish translation...

    >>> file_content = tarfile.extractfile(
    ...     'evolution-2.2/evolution-2.2-es.po')
    >>> file_content.readline()
