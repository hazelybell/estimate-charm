                <strong>Find and work with the right people</strong> by using Launchpad to build a social network of individuals and teams around projects. Each action in Launchpad &mdash; a bug reported, a branch updated, a package published &mdash; is attributed to the person responsible, making it easy to get in touch with people whose work interests you.
<br /><br />
Launchpad also helps you organise the social structure of your community with a simple teams system, complete with mailing lists. Through teams you can share work and responsibilities, such as commit rights to a branch or supervising a project&rsquo;s bug reports.

                            Teams in Launchpad can each have their own mailing list with everything you&rsquo;d expect: simple subscription management, automatic archiving and virtually no need for list administration.</p>
                            <p>Even better, Launchpad shares the burden of administration across each mailing list community by building a global picture of how each person&rsquo;s posts are moderated across different lists.

                            Teams are interchangable with individuals in just about any role in Launchpad, such as <a href="bugs">bug triage</a>, owning a <a href="branch-hosting-tracking">branch of code</a> or publishing software packages through a <a href="ppa">PPA</a>. You can create as many teams as you want and even arrange a hierarchy of teams so that all the members of one team are also automatically members of another. Launchpad&rsquo;s team functionality is unique among tools for free software developers.

                            When you come across work that impresses you, one click on the owner&rsquo;s name lets you see at a glance what they&rsquo;ve worked on, what interests them, what timezone they&rsquo;re in and how to contact them.

                        <p>
                            Each person&rsquo;s karma report gives you a short-hand indication of their current activity. File a bug: get karma. Publish a branch of code: get karma. Answer a support question: get karma. Launchpad distills all recent activity down to a relative karma value but you can also peek behind the headline number to see where and how frequently people have been contributing.
