Queue Notify
============

PackageUpload has a notify() method to send emails. We need to be logged
into the security model in order to get any further.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

Get a packageupload object for netapplet, which has a relatively intact
set of supporting sample data.  It has rows in distribution,
distroseries, sourcepackagerelease, person and a librarian entry for the
changes file which are all needed for successful operation of notify().

    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.queue import IPackageUploadSet
    >>> netapplet_upload = getUtility(IPackageUploadSet)[3]
    >>> print netapplet_upload.displayname
    netapplet

Set up some library files for the netapplet source package.  These are
not already present in the sample data.

    >>> from lp.services.librarian.interfaces import (
    ...     ILibraryFileAliasSet)
    >>> from lp.archiveuploader.tests import datadir
    >>> import os
    >>> netapplet_spr = netapplet_upload.sources[0].sourcepackagerelease
    >>> librarian = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)
    >>> files = [
    ...     'netapplet_1.0-1.dsc',
    ...     'netapplet_1.0.orig.tar.gz',
    ...     'netapplet_1.0-1.diff.gz',
    ...     ]
    >>> for file in files:
    ...     filepath = datadir('suite/netapplet_1.0-1/%s' % file)
    ...     fileobj = open(filepath, 'rb')
    ...     filesize = os.stat(filepath).st_size
    ...     lfa = librarian.create(file, filesize, fileobj, 'dummytype')
    ...     sprf = netapplet_spr.addFile(lfa)
    ...     fileobj.close()

The notify() method generates one email here on this unsigned package.
It requires an announcement list email address, a "changes_file_object"
that is just an open file object for the original changes file, and a
special logger object that will extract tracebacks for the purposes of
this doctest.

    >>> changes_file_path = datadir(
    ...     'suite/netapplet_1.0-1/netapplet_1.0-1_source.changes')
    >>> changes_file = open(changes_file_path,'r')
    >>> from lp.services.log.logger import FakeLogger
    >>> netapplet_upload.notify(
    ...     changes_file_object=changes_file, logger=FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Building recipients list.
    DEBUG Changes file is unsigned; adding changer as recipient.
    ...
    DEBUG Sent a mail:
    ...
    DEBUG   Recipients: ... Silverstone ...
    ...
    DEBUG above if files already exist in other distroseries.
    ...
    DEBUG signer of the above package.

Helper functions to examine emails that were sent:

    >>> from lp.services.mail import stub
    >>> from lp.testing.mail_helpers import pop_notifications

There's only one email generated from the preceding upload:

    >>> [notification] = pop_notifications()

The mail headers contain our To: as set on the notify() call.  The
subject contains "Accepted", the package name, its version and whether
it's source or binary.  The Bcc field also always contains the
uploader's email address.

    >>> notification['To']
    'Daniel Silverstone <daniel.silverstone@canonical.com>'

    >>> notification['Bcc']
    'Root <root@localhost>'

    >>> notification['Subject']
    '[ubuntu/breezy-autotest] netapplet 0.99.6-1 (New)'

The mail body contains a list of files that were accepted:

    >>> print notification.get_payload(0) # doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    From nobody ...
    ...
    NEW: netapplet_1.0-1.dsc
    NEW: netapplet_1.0.orig.tar.gz
    NEW: netapplet_1.0-1.diff.gz
    <BLANKLINE>
    ...
    You may have gotten the distroseries wrong.  If so, you may get warnings
    above if files already exist in other distroseries.
    <BLANKLINE>
    -- =
    <BLANKLINE>
    You are receiving this email because you are the uploader, maintainer or
    signer of the above package.
    <BLANKLINE>

Now we will process a signed package.  Signed packages will potentially
have a different recipient list to unsigned ones; recipients for signed
package uploads can be the signer, the maintainer and the changer, where
these people are different.  Unsigned packages only send notifications
to the changer.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.gpg import IGPGKeySet
    >>> gpgkey = getUtility(IGPGKeySet).get(1)
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(netapplet_upload).signing_key = gpgkey

Now request the email:

    >>> changes_file_path = datadir(
    ...     'suite/netapplet_1.0-1-signed/netapplet_1.0-1_source.changes')
    >>> changes_file = open(changes_file_path,'r')
    >>> netapplet_upload.setAccepted()
    >>> netapplet_upload.notify(
    ...     changes_file_object=changes_file, logger=FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Building recipients list.
    ...
    DEBUG Sent a mail:
    ...
    DEBUG     Recipients: ... Bar ...
    ...
    DEBUG Announcing to autotest_changes@ubuntu.com
    ...
    DEBUG Sent a mail:
    ...

There are two emails, the upload acknowledgement and the announcement,
because this upload is already accepted.

    >>> msgs = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(msgs)
    2

The mail 'To:' addresses contain the signer and the changer's email.
The announcement email contains the serieses changeslist.

    >>> def to_lower(address):
    ...     """Return lower-case version of email address."""
    ...     return address.lower()

    >>> def extract_addresses(header_field):
    ...     """Extract and sort addresses from an email header field."""
    ...     return sorted(
    ...         [addr.strip() for addr in header_field.split(',')],
    ...         key=to_lower)

    >>> for addr in extract_addresses(msgs[0]['To']):
    ...     print addr
    Daniel Silverstone <daniel.silverstone@canonical.com>
    Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>

    >>> print msgs[1]['To']
    autotest_changes@ubuntu.com

The mail 'Bcc:' address is the uploader.  The announcement has the
uploader and the Debian derivatives address for the package uploaded.

    >>> for msg in msgs:
    ...     print extract_addresses(msg['Bcc'])
    ['Root <root@localhost>']
    ['netapplet_derivatives@packages.qa.debian.org', 'Root <root@localhost>']

The mail 'From:' addresses are the uploader and the changer.

    >>> for msg in msgs:
    ...     print msg['From']
    Root <root@localhost>
    Daniel Silverstone <daniel.silverstone@canonical.com>

    >>> print notification['Subject']
    [ubuntu/breezy-autotest] netapplet 0.99.6-1 (New)

The mail body contains the same list of files again:

    >>> print notification.get_payload(0) # doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    From nobody ...
    ...
    NEW: netapplet_1.0-1.dsc
    NEW: netapplet_1.0.orig.tar.gz
    NEW: netapplet_1.0-1.diff.gz
    <BLANKLINE>
    ...
    You may have gotten the distroseries wrong.  If so, you may get warnings
    above if files already exist in other distroseries.
    <BLANKLINE>
    -- =
    <BLANKLINE>
    You are receiving this email because you are the uploader, maintainer or
    signer of the above package.
    <BLANKLINE>

notify() will also work without passing the changes_file_object
parameter provided that everything is already committed to the database
(which is not the case when nascent upload runs).  This example
demonstrates this usage:

    >>> from lp.services.librarianserver.testing.server import fillLibrarianFile
    >>> changes_file = open(changes_file_path,"r")
    >>> fillLibrarianFile(1, content=changes_file.read())
    >>> changes_file.close()
    >>> from lp.soyuz.enums import PackageUploadStatus
    >>> from lp.soyuz.model.queue import PassthroughStatusValue
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(netapplet_upload).status = PassthroughStatusValue(
    ...     PackageUploadStatus.NEW)
    >>> netapplet_upload.notify(logger=FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Building recipients list.
    ...
    DEBUG Sent a mail:
    ...
    DEBUG     Recipients: ... Silverstone ...
    ...
    DEBUG above if files already exist in other distroseries.
    ...
    DEBUG signer of the above package.

Only one email is generated:

    >>> [notification] = pop_notifications()

The mail headers are the same as before:

    >>> for addr in extract_addresses(notification['To']):
    ...     print addr
    Daniel Silverstone <daniel.silverstone@canonical.com>
    Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>

    >>> print notification['Bcc']
    Root <root@localhost>

    >>> print notification['Subject']
    [ubuntu/breezy-autotest] netapplet 0.99.6-1 (New)

The mail body contains the same list of files again:

    >>> print notification.get_payload(0) # doctest: -NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    From nobody ...
    ...
    NEW: netapplet_1.0-1.dsc
    NEW: netapplet_1.0.orig.tar.gz
    NEW: netapplet_1.0-1.diff.gz
    <BLANKLINE>
    ...
    You may have gotten the distroseries wrong.  If so, you may get warnings

    <BLANKLINE>
    -- =
    <BLANKLINE>
    You are receiving this email because you are the uploader, maintainer or
    signer of the above package.
    <BLANKLINE>

notify() will also generate rejection notices if the upload failed.  The
summary_text argument is text that is appended to any auto-generated
text for the summary.  Rejections don't currently auto-generate
anything.

    >>> netapplet_upload.setRejected()
    >>> netapplet_upload.notify(
    ...     summary_text="Testing rejection message", logger=FakeLogger())
    DEBUG Building recipients list.
    ...
    DEBUG Sending rejection email.
    ...
    DEBUG   Subject: [ubuntu/breezy-autotest] netapplet 0.99.6-1 (Rejected)
    DEBUG   Sender: Root <root@localhost>
    DEBUG   Recipients: ... Bar ...
    DEBUG   Bcc: Root <root@localhost>
    DEBUG   Body:
    DEBUG Rejected:
    DEBUG Testing rejection message
    ...
    DEBUG If you don't understand why your files were rejected, or if the
    ...
    DEBUG signer of the above package.

Only one email is generated:

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    1

Clean up, otherwise stuff is left lying around in /var/tmp.

    >>> from lp.testing.layers import LibrarianLayer
    >>> LibrarianLayer.librarian_fixture.clear()
