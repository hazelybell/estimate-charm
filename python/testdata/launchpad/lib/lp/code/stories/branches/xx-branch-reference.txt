Branch References
=================

Users often get Launchpad pages about branches mixed up with branch
URLs.  To reduce frustration, we redirect Bazaar to the real branch
URL when this happens rather than giving a 404 error.

Given the number of HTTP requests Bazaar makes, we don't want all
those requests hitting the Launchpad webapp.  We can achieve this
through the use of a Bazaar branch reference.

Bazaar branch references were designed for use with lightweight
checkouts.  Rather than storing the branch information locally, they
just contain a pointer to where the branch data really is.  This fits
our use case perfectly, since Bazaar will only make three requests
before finding the real branch location.

The first request made is to find the bzrdir format:

  >>> branchurl = ('http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+branch/'
  ...              'gnome-terminal/main')
  >>> anon_browser.open(branchurl + '/.bzr/branch-format')
  >>> anon_browser.contents
  'Bazaar-NG meta directory, format 1\n'

Once it has been determined that we have a meta-dir format bzrdir, the
branch format is checked:

  >>> anon_browser.open(branchurl + '/.bzr/branch/format')
  >>> anon_browser.contents
  'Bazaar-NG Branch Reference Format 1\n'

Now Bazaar knows that it has a branch reference.  The final request is
to find the real branch location.  We return Launchpad's HTTP URL for
the branch:

  >>> anon_browser.open(branchurl + '/.bzr/branch/location')
  >>> anon_browser.contents
  'http://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~name12/gnome-terminal/main'


Product Series Branch
---------------------

A branch can be nominated as representing a product series.  A branch
reference is provided for product series too:

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/'
  ...                   'evolution/trunk/.bzr/branch/location')
  >>> anon_browser.contents
  'http://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/evolution/main'


However, if a product series has no branch associated with it, we get
a 404 error:

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/'
  ...                   'firefox/1.0/.bzr/branch/location')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  NotFound: ... u'.bzr'


Product Branch
--------------

Each product has a series set as the development focus.  A branch
reference is provided for a product, providing the branch for the
development focus:

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/'
  ...                   'evolution/.bzr/branch/location')
  >>> anon_browser.contents
  'http://bazaar.launchpad.dev/~vcs-imports/evolution/main'


However, if the development focus of a product has no branch
associated with it, we get a 404 error:

  >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/'
  ...                   'firefox/.bzr/branch/location')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  NotFound: ... u'.bzr'
