    <h1>Verifying a download</h1>

    <p>
      There are two ways to check the files you've downloaded from a project:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>using the MD5 sum that Launchpad generates</li>
      <li>optionally, using the digital signature generated if the uploader
          signed the file.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The difference between the two is that the MD5 lets you check the file
      hasn't changed between leaving Launchpad and arriving on your machine,
      whereas the signature lets you check that the file hasn't changed since
      it was signed.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the MD5 sum</h2>

    <p>
      When a project maintainer uploads a file that they want to make
      available for download, Launchpad analyzes the file using the MD5
      hashing algorithm. This produces a short sequence of letters and
      numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use that sequence, called the MD5 sum, to check that the file
      has arrived on your machine intact.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the MD5 sum by following the <code>md5
      </code> link next to the file you've downloaded.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a terminal, enter the directory where you
      downloaded the file and type:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>md5sum filename</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously you need to replace <em>filename</em> with the name of the
      file you downloaded.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> You'll see an MD5 sum. Check that it's the same
      as the one you obtained in step 1. If the two sums are different, there
      has been a problem downloading the file.  You should delete the file and
      try downloading it again.  Do not use the file if the MD5 sums do not
      match.
    </p>

    <h2>Verifying a signature</h2>

    <p>
      When a project maintainer uploads a file to Launchpad, they have the
      option of also digitally signing the file and uploading the resultant
      signature.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can tell which files have a signature by looking out for the <em>sig
      </em> link alongside the <em>md5</em> link. Verifying the files
      signature lets you check that the file is exactly as intended by whoever
      signed the file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the signature file to the same
      directory where you've downloaded the project file you want to verify.
      The signature file will have the same name as the project file you've
      downloaded but with <em>.asc</em> or <em>.sig</em> appended to the end.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a terminal, change to the directory where
      you have saved the file and accompanying signature, then enter the
      following:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>gpg --verify <em>signaturefilename</em></code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Replace <em>signaturefilename</em> with the signature's filename.
    </p>

    <p>
      gpg will now try to check the signature against the signer's public
      key. If your version of gpg is configured to retrieve public keys
      automatically, you can skip to step 4. Otherwise, you'll need to fetch
      the signer's public key manually.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> If gpg can't find the public key on your local
      system, it will give you an error message similar to this:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>gpg: Signature made Sun 28 Jun 2009 02:20:52 BST using DSA key ID
      2F9532C8<br />
      gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      That's no problem: you can easily retrieve the public key. Simply copy
      the key ID; it's the alphanumeric code, <code>2F9532C8</code>, at the
      end of the first line of the error message.
    </p>

    <p>Next, enter:</p>

    <p><code>gpg --recv-keys 2F9532C8</code></p>

    <p>
      gpg will now pull down the public key and you can re-run <code>gpg
      --verify <em>signaturefilename</em></code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> We're nearly done! You'll see a message from
      gpg that is similar to this:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>gpg: Signature made Sun 28 Jun 2009 02:20:52 BST using DSA key ID
      2F9532C8<br />
      gpg: Good signature from "Guillermo Gonzalez &lt;
      guillermo.gonzalez@canonical.com&gt;"<br />
      gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!<br />
      gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the
      owner.<br />
      Primary key fingerprint: CDD8 87C2 C5CE CD1A C593  8EEF 698A D97E 2F95
      32C8</code></p>

    <p>
      This message shows that the file hasn't changed since it was signed by
      the uploader. Because Launchpad allows only a project's owners and
      series release managers to upload files for download, you may decide
      that this is enough confirmation that the file is good.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, you can verify that the public key is owned by someone that you
      trust from the project.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Visit <a href="https://launchpad.net/people"
      target="_blank">Launchpad's people search</a> page and search for the
      person name in the output from <code>gpg --verify</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From their profile page, you can check their involvement in the project
      and also that they own the key used to sign the file you downloaded.
