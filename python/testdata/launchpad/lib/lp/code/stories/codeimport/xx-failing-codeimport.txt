= Retrying a failed import =

Imports that have failed more than the configured
'consecutive_failure_limit' times in a row are no longer attempted.

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> from lp.code.tests.codeimporthelpers import (
    ...     make_finished_import)
    >>> from lp.services.config import config
    >>> from lp.code.interfaces.codeimportresult import CodeImportResultStatus
    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(name='imported')
    >>> owner = factory.makePerson(name='import-owner')
    >>> code_import = factory.makeProductCodeImport(
    ...     product=product, branch_name='trunk', registrant=owner)
    >>> for i in range(config.codeimport.consecutive_failure_limit):
    ...     dummy = make_finished_import(
    ...         code_import, CodeImportResultStatus.FAILURE,
    ...         factory=factory)
    >>> logout()

This is shown on the branch index page:

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/~import-owner/imported/trunk')
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'failing-try-again'))
    The import has been suspended because it failed 5 or more times in succession.

Any logged in user will also see a button that can request the import
be tried again.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Try Again')
    <SubmitControl ...>

Anonymous users do not see this button, however.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://code.launchpad.dev/~import-owner/imported/trunk')
    >>> anon_browser.getControl('Try Again')
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    LookupError: ...

Clicking on the link sets the review status back to REVIEWED and
requests that an import be performed immediately.

    >>> def print_import_details(browser):
    ...     div = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'import-details')
    ...     print extract_text(div)
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Try Again').click()
    >>> print_import_details(user_browser)
    Import Status: Reviewed
    ...
    The next import is scheduled to run as soon as possible (requested by
    No Privileges Person).
