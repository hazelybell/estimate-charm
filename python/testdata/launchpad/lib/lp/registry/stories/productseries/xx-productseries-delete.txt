Delete a productseries
======================

A project series can be made by accident and the project owner or driver
may choose to delete it. Sample Person is the owner of the Firefox
project and he wants to delete the trunk series because development
is really happening in the 1.0 series.

    >>> owner_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> owner_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/trunk')
    >>> print owner_browser.title
    Series trunk : Mozilla Firefox

    >>> owner_browser.getLink('Delete series').click()
    >>> print owner_browser.title
    Delete Mozilla Firefox trunk series...

The trunk series is the focus of development. It cannot be deleted.
The owner learns that he must make another series the focus of development
first. There is no delete button on the page.

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(owner_browser.contents, 'cannot-delete'))
    You cannot delete a series that is the focus of development. Make
    another series the focus of development before deleting this one.
    You cannot delete a series that is linked to packages in distributions.
    You can remove the links from the project packaging page.

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Delete this Series')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    LookupError: ...

Sample person chooses to cancel the action and make the 1.0 series the focus
of development. He then removes the linked package which he believes is
bogus.

    >>> owner_browser.getLink('Cancel').click()
    >>> owner_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/+edit')
    >>> print owner_browser.title
    Change Mozilla Firefox's details...

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Development focus').value = ['2']
    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Change').click()
    >>> print owner_browser.title
    Mozilla Firefox in Launchpad

    >>> owner_browser.getLink('All packages').click()
    >>> link = owner_browser.getLink(
    ...     url='/ubuntu/warty/+source/mozilla-firefox/+remove-packaging')
    >>> link.click()
    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Unlink').click()

Then he returns to delete trunk. He is informed that deletion is permanent,
and that the milestones, releases, and files will also be deleted. The
milestones and releases are linked.

    >>> owner_browser.getLink('trunk series').click()
    >>> owner_browser.getLink('Delete series').click()
    >>> print owner_browser.title
    Delete Mozilla Firefox trunk series...

    >>> contents = find_main_content(owner_browser.contents)
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(contents, 'milestones-and-files'))
    The associated milestones and releases
    and their files will be also be deleted:

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(contents, 'milestones'))
    0.9.2 "One (secure) Tree Hill"
    0.9.1 "One Tree Hill (v2)"
    0.9 "One Tree Hill"
    1.0

    >>> print owner_browser.getLink('0.9.2 "One (secure) Tree Hill"')
    <Link text='0.9.2 "One (secure) Tree Hill"' ...>

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(contents, 'files'))
    firefox_0.9.2.orig.tar.gz

    >>> print extract_text(
    ... find_tag_by_id(contents, 'bugtasks-and-blueprints'))
    Support E4X in EcmaScript

The owner deletes the series and the project page is displayed. He reads
that the series was deleted, and can not see a link to it anymore.

    >>> owner_browser.getControl('Delete this Series').click()
    >>> print owner_browser.title
    Mozilla Firefox in Launchpad

    >>> print_feedback_messages(owner_browser.contents)
    Series trunk deleted.

    >>> owner_browser.getLink('trunk')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    LinkNotFoundError

A series with translations can never be deleted. The project owner or
release manager sees the explaination when he tries to delete the series.

    >>> owner_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk')
    >>> owner_browser.getLink('Delete series').click()
    >>> print owner_browser.title
    Delete Evolution trunk series ...

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(owner_browser.contents, 'cannot-delete'))
    You ...
    This series cannot be deleted because it has translations.
