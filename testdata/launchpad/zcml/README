This is all a bit speculative.

Entry points
============

These are the bits of ZCML that are explicitly loaded by Python code. These
ZCML files in turn load other parts.

  webapp.zcml
    The big kahuna. Various config files (e.g. launchpad.conf) refer to
    this file.  For the time being, site.zcml exists as an alias in the
    root directory of the Launchpad tree, since production configuration
    files depend on it being there.

  ftesting.zcml
    Used to configure the functional testing layer.  Look in
    lp.testing.layers to see how it gets hooked in.

  script.zcml
    The main ZCML used for "scripts". Anything that runs in the Zopeless layer
    uses this.  See ``execute_zcml_for_scripts``.

  script-testing.zcml
    As for script.zcml, but for testing said scripts.
