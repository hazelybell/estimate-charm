Poll preconditions
==================

There's some preconditions that we need to meet to vote in polls and remove
options from them, Not meeting these preconditions is a programming error and
should be threated as so.

  >>> from zope.component import getUtility
  >>> from lp.services.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
  >>> from lp.testing import login
  >>> from datetime import timedelta
  >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
  >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.poll import IPollSet

  >>> ubuntu_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(17)
  >>> ubuntu_team_member = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(1)
  >>> ubuntu_team_nonmember = getUtility(IPersonSet).get(12)

  >>> pollset = getUtility(IPollSet)
  >>> director_election = pollset.getByTeamAndName(ubuntu_team,
  ...                                              'director-2004')
  >>> director_options = director_election.getActiveOptions()
  >>> leader_election = pollset.getByTeamAndName(ubuntu_team, 'leader-2004')
  >>> leader_options = leader_election.getActiveOptions()
  >>> opendate = leader_election.dateopens
  >>> onesec = timedelta(seconds=1)


If the poll is already opened, it's impossible to remove an option.

  >>> leader_election.removeOption(leader_options[0], when=opendate)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError


Trying to vote two times is a programming error.
  
  >>> votes = leader_election.storeSimpleVote(
  ...     ubuntu_team_member, leader_options[0], when=opendate)

  >>> votes = leader_election.storeSimpleVote(
  ...     ubuntu_team_member, leader_options[0], when=opendate)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: Can't vote twice in the same poll


It's not possible for a non-member to vote, neither to vote when the poll is
not open.

  >>> votes = leader_election.storeSimpleVote(
  ...     ubuntu_team_nonmember, leader_options[0], when=opendate)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: Person ... is not a member of this poll's team.

  >>> votes = leader_election.storeSimpleVote(
  ...     ubuntu_team_member, leader_options[0], when=opendate - onesec)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: This poll is not open


It's not possible to vote on an option that doesn't belong to the poll you're
voting in.

  >>> options = {leader_options[0]: 1}
  >>> votes = director_election.storeCondorcetVote(
  ...     ubuntu_team_member, options, when=opendate)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  AssertionError: The option ... doesn't belong to this poll
