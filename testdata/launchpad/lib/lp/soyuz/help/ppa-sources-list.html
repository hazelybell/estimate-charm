    <h1>How do I use software from a PPA?</h1>

    <p>
      To start installing and using software from a Personal Package Archive,
       you first need to tell Ubuntu where to find the PPA.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> The contents of Personal Package Archives
      are not checked or monitored. You install software from them at your own
      risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're using the most recent version of Ubuntu (or any version from
      Ubuntu 9.10 onwards), you can add a PPA to your system with a single
      line in your terminal.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> On the PPA's overview page, look for the
      heading that reads <em>Adding this PPA to your system</em>. Make a note
      of the PPA's location, which looks like:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>ppa:gwibber-daily/ppa</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Open a terminal and enter:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/ppa-name</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Replace <code>ppa:user/ppa-name</code> with the PPA's location that you
      noted above.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your system will now fetch the PPA's key. This enables your Ubuntu
      system to verify that the packages in the PPA have not been interfered
      with since they were built.
    </p>

    <img src="images/add-apt-repo2.png" alt="Screen shot of a system retrieving the PPA details" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" />

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, as a one-off, you should tell your system
      to pull down the latest list of software from each archive it knows
      about, including the PPA you just added:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>sudo apt-get update</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now you're ready to start installing software from the PPA!
