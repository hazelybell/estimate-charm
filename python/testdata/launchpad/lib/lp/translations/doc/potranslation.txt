POTranslation
=============

This is the class that holds the text of translations in the database.

    >>> from lp.translations.model.potranslation import POTranslation

Creating one is easy.

    >>> created = POTranslation(translation="This is a launchpad test")

To get hold of a PO translation, use POTranslation.byTranslation.

    >>> got = POTranslation.byTranslation("This is a launchpad test")
    >>> got == created
    True
    >>> got.translation
    u'This is a launchpad test'

However, if the translation doesn't already exist, you'll get an error.

    >>> got = POTranslation.byTranslation("In Xanadu did Kubla Khan")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    SQLObjectNotFound: In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

If you want to get hold of one, and have it automatically created if it
doesn't already exist, use POTranslation.getOrCreateTranslation.

    >>> got = POTranslation.getOrCreateTranslation("In Xanadu did Kubla Khan")
    >>> got.translation
    u'In Xanadu did Kubla Khan'

If you want to pass non-ascii characters to either of these, it had better be
either UTF-8 string or, better, a unicode object.

    >>> got = POTranslation.getOrCreateTranslation('\xc3\x81')
    >>> got = POTranslation.getOrCreateTranslation(u'\u00c2')

    >>> got = POTranslation.getOrCreateTranslation('\xc0')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xc0 in position...
