Distribution series language packs admin
========================================

For each distribution series, we can select several special language packs:

 - The one that has a full export use as the base export to get updates from.
 - The one that has translation updates based on the base export.
 - The one that is being tested which will become either a base one or an
   update one, depending of its type.


From this page, we are able to select which one of all the exported objects
availables will be set as the base, update or proposed/testing.

To reach that page we go to the distro series page and follow the link to
the language pack admin page.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://translations.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/hoary')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('See all language packs').click()

Initially, there is no package selected and there are options for choosing a
base language pack.

    >>> base = admin_browser.getControl('Language pack base')
    >>> print base.displayValue
    ['(nothing selected)']
    >>> base.displayOptions
    ['(nothing selected)', '2007-09-10 19:16:01 UTC', '2007-09-10 19:14:26 UTC']
    >>> delta = admin_browser.getControl('Language pack update')
    >>> print delta.displayValue
    ['(nothing selected)']
    >>> proposed = admin_browser.getControl('Proposed language pack update')
    >>> print proposed.displayValue
    ['(nothing selected)']

Let's select a base one:

    >>> base.displayValue = ['2007-09-10 19:14:26 UTC']
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change').click()
    >>> print admin_browser.url
    http://translations.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/hoary/+language-packs

Now the admin page will show us that language pack selected and a list of
available update packages.

    >>> base = admin_browser.getControl('Language pack base')
    >>> print base.displayValue
    ['2007-09-10 19:14:26 UTC']

    >>> update = admin_browser.getControl('Language pack update')
    >>> print update.displayValue
    ['(nothing selected)']
    >>> update.displayOptions
    ['(nothing selected)', '2007-09-10 19:15:19 UTC', '2007-09-10 19:15:01 UTC']

Those changes are shown in the public language pack listing web page:

    >>> browser.open('http://translations.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/hoary')
    >>> browser.getLink('See all language packs').click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, "language_packs"))
    A language pack...

The active base language pack URL is linking to an archive, while the latest
URL uses '+latest-full-language-pack'.

    >>> print browser.getLink('2007-09-10 19:14:26 UTC').url
    http.../71/ubuntu-hoary-translations.tar.gz
    >>> print browser.getLink('2007-09-10 19:16:01 UTC').url
    http://translations.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/hoary/+latest-full-language-pack

An administrator can choose the current update pack and there is also an
option to set/unset whether next language pack generation is a full export:

    >>> update = admin_browser.getControl('Language pack update')
    >>> update.displayValue = ['2007-09-10 19:15:01 UTC']
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Request a full language pack export').selected
    False
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Request a full language pack export').selected = True
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Change').click()
    >>> print admin_browser.url
    http://translations.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/hoary/+language-packs
    >>> print_feedback_messages(admin_browser.contents)
    Your request has been noted. Next language pack export will include
    all available translations...

Once the system accepts the submission, we can see such change applied.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...     'Request a full language pack export').selected
    True

There are no visible user interface changes once this flag is changed. It
just changes the behaviour of the language pack export, which is executed by
cron, it will do a full export of translations for this distro series.

The language pack changes are visible on the public language pack page:

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://translations.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/hoary/+language-packs')
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, "language_packs"))
