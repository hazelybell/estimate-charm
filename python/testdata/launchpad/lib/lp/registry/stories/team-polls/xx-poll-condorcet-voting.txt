  Go to a condorcet-style poll (which is still open) and check that apart
  from seeing our vote we can also change it.

  ...You must enter your vote key...
  ...This is a secret poll...
  ...your vote is identified only by the key you...
  ...were given when you voted. To view or change your vote you must enter...
  ...your key:...

  If a non-member (Sample Person) guesses the voting URL and tries to vote,
  he won't be allowed.

  By providing the token we will be able to see our current vote.

  It's also possible to change the vote, if wanted.

  Now we go to another poll in which name16 voted. But this time it's a public
  one, so there's no need to provide the token to see the current vote.

  >>> print http(r"""

  ...
                  <p>Your current vote is as follows:</p>
                  <p>
  <BLANKLINE>
                      <b>1</b>.
                      Option 1
  <BLANKLINE>
                  </p>
                  <p>
  <BLANKLINE>
                      <b>2</b>.
                      Option 2
  <BLANKLINE>
                  </p>
                  <p>
  <BLANKLINE>
                      <b>3</b>.
                      Option 3

                  <p>
  <BLANKLINE>
                      <b>4</b>.
                      Option 4

  Now we change the vote and we see the new vote displayed as our current
  vote.

  Logged in as mark@example.com (which is a member of ubuntu-team), go to a public
  condorcet-style poll that's still open and get redirected to a page where
  it's possible to vote (and see the current vote).
