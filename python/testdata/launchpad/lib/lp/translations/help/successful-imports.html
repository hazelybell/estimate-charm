    <h1>Importing translation files from a Bazaar branch</h1>

    <p>
      When importing translation files into Launchpad from a tarball or
      a Bazaar branch, you must follow our <a
      href="https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/YourProject/ImportPolicy"
      target="_blank">translations import policy</a>. At a minimum, your
      tarball or branch must:
    </p>

    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>Contain at least one <code>.pot</code> file with English strings,
      rather than message IDs or another language. You cannot upload a
      <code>.po</code> file on its own.</li>
      <li>Give each template its own directory (<a href="/+help-translations/directory-example.html"
      >see an example directory layout</a>).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The first time you upload a template, it'll usually take a few days
       before it is approved. However, imports from Bazaar branches are
       usually approved sooner than imports from tarballs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Subsequent updates to templates, and <code>.po</code> files will be
      approved automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      Following approval, the English strings, and any translations, will be
      available in Launchpad within one day and usually much sooner.
    </p>
