= Requesting a one-time import of translation files =
Product maintainers can request a one-time import of translation files
from the Bazaar branch that is officially linked to the release series
of a product. This function complements the general import settings
found on the "Settings" page.

== Getting there ==
The maintainer of a product sees a menu option called "Reqeust Bazaar
import" that leads to the page to request such imports.

    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization',
    ...                   'Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk/')
    >>> browser.getLink('Request an import from bazaar').click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://translations.l...d.dev/evolution/trunk/+request-bzr-import

== The request page with a branch ==
The product series must have a branch configured in order to be able
to request an import. The current branch is displayed on the page.

    >>> branch = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'branch-display')
    >>> print extract_text(branch)
    The official Bazaar branch is:
    lp://dev/evolution

If the product series is not configured to import translation files
continuously, the user is reminded of that here.

    >>> settings = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'settings-display')
    >>> print extract_text(settings)
    To enable continuous imports please change the settings here.
    >>> browser.getLink('here').click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://translations.l...d.dev/evolution/trunk/+translations-settings

Changing that setting will make that message disappear from the page.

    >>> browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.translations_autoimport_mode').value = (
    ...         ['IMPORT_TEMPLATES'])
    >>> browser.getControl('Save settings').click()
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk/'
    ...     '+request-bzr-import')
    >>> settings = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'settings-display')
    >>> print settings
    None

The request is made by clicking on a button labeled
"Request one-time import".

    >>> request_button = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     browser.contents, 'field.actions.request_import')
    >>> print request_button
    <input type="submit"...value="Request one-time import"...
    >>> browser.getControl("Request one-time import").click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk
    >>> print_feedback_messages(browser.contents)
    The import has been requested.

== The request page without a branch ==
The official Bazaar branch gets removed from the product series.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk/+setbranch')
    >>> browser.getControl(name='field.branch_location').value = ''
    >>> browser.getControl('Update').click()

Since the product series does not have a branch set now, requesting an
import is pointless. The page points the user to the fact and where to
set the branch.

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk/'
    ...     '+request-bzr-import')
    >>> branch = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-branch-display')
    >>> print extract_text(branch)
    This series does not have an official Bazaar branch.
    Please set it first.
    >>> browser.getLink('Please set it first.').click()
    >>> print browser.url
    http://launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk/+setbranch

The request button is missing completely from the page.

    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk/'
    ...     '+request-bzr-import')
    >>> request_button = find_tag_by_id(
    ...     browser.contents, 'field.actions.request_import')
    >>> print request_button
    None
