=============================

Test for the product/+download page.

    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(name='alfajore')
    >>> productseries = factory.makeProductSeries(
    ...     product=product, name="sammy")
    >>> milestone = factory.makeMilestone(productseries=productseries,

    >>> view.batch_size
    4

    >>> batch = view.series_and_releases_batch.currentBatch()
    >>> print len(list(batch))
    1

    >>> def print_series_release(sr):
    ...     print "%s from the %s series" % (sr.release.name_with_codename,

For an administrator of the project, at the bottom of each batched
page will be links to add new files for each series and release.

    >>> from lp.testing.pages import (
    ...     extract_text, find_tag_by_id)
    >>> ignored = login_person(product.owner)
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(product, '+download',
    ...                                principal=product.owner)
    >>> admin_links = find_tag_by_id(view.render(), 'admin-links')
    >>> content = extract_text(admin_links)
    >>> print content
    Add download file to the s4 series for release: 4.3, 4.2, 4.1
    Add download file to the s3 series for release: 3.3, 3.2, 3.1
    Add download file to the s2 series for release: 2.3, 2.2, 2.1
    Add download file to the s1 series for release: 1.3, 1.2, 1.1

The product index view shows the latest release for the project.

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(product, name='+index')
    >>> print view.latest_release_with_download_files.version

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.series import SeriesStatus

    >>> obsolete_series = product.getSeries('s4')
    >>> obsolete_series.status = SeriesStatus.OBSOLETE
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(product, name='+index')
    >>> print view.latest_release_with_download_files.version
