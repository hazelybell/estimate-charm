= Code review comments =

When code is proposed to be merged, it's common to perform a review of
that code, which is often in the form of a conversation.  The reviewer
asks questions, makes comments, and offers an opinion (a 'vote') on
whether or not the code should be merged.  The submitter responds to the
reviewer until submitter and reviewer and reach an agreement about the
status of the code or conclude that agreement cannot be reached.

The ICodeReviewComment interface represents this kind of conversation.
It has an IMessage as a member (in a one-to-one relationship), a vote
(which is an enum), and a reference to the IBranchMergeProposal it is
about.


== Creating CodeReviewComments ==

CodeReviewComments are created from their BranchMergeProposals:

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> from lp.testing.factory import LaunchpadObjectFactory
    >>> factory = LaunchpadObjectFactory()
    >>> merge_proposal = factory.makeBranchMergeProposal()
    >>> sender = factory.makePerson(
    ...     email='sender@example.com', displayname='Sender Person')
    >>> comment = merge_proposal.createComment(
    ...     sender, 'Please merge', 'This patch is very nice.')

The initial email that gets sent out has the message_id stored in the merge
proposal.  Subsequent comments are marked as replies to the initial email.

    >>> from lp.code.enums import CodeReviewVote
    >>> comment2 = merge_proposal.createComment(
    ...     sender, 'No!', 'You are ugly and stupid',
    ...     CodeReviewVote.DISAPPROVE)
    >>> comment2.message.parent is None
    True

Comments can be marked as replies to particular comments.

    >>> comment3 = merge_proposal.createComment(
    ...     sender, 'Hurt', "That wasn't a nice thing to say.",
    ...     parent=comment2)
    >>> comment3.message.parent == comment2.message
    True

When comments are added, a job is created to send the emails to the
subscribers of the merge proposal.

    >>> # Needed for now to make the iterReady show the jobs.
    >>> factory.makeRevisionsForBranch(merge_proposal.source_branch)
    >>> factory.makeRevisionsForBranch(merge_proposal.target_branch)
    >>> from lp.code.tests.helpers import mark_all_merge_proposal_jobs_done
    >>> mark_all_merge_proposal_jobs_done()

If there is a subscriber to any of the branches involved in the merge,
a notification is produced when the comment is created.

    >>> from lp.code.enums import (
    ...     BranchSubscriptionDiffSize, BranchSubscriptionNotificationLevel,
    ...     CodeReviewNotificationLevel)
    >>> source_subscriber = factory.makePerson(
    ...     email='subscriber@example.com', displayname='Subscriber Person')
    >>> _unused = merge_proposal.source_branch.subscribe(source_subscriber,
    ...     BranchSubscriptionNotificationLevel.NOEMAIL,
    ...     BranchSubscriptionDiffSize.NODIFF,
    ...     CodeReviewNotificationLevel.FULL, source_subscriber)
    >>> from lp.testing.mail_helpers import (
    ...     pop_notifications, print_emails)
    >>> _unused = pop_notifications()
    >>> merge_proposal.root_message_id = '<201003111740.test.root@example.com>'
    >>> comment = merge_proposal.createComment(
    ...     sender, 'Please merge', 'This patch is very nice.',
    ...     vote=CodeReviewVote.APPROVE, review_type='DB')

Now run the pending job to send the email.

    >>> from lp.code.interfaces.branchmergeproposal import (
    ...     IBranchMergeProposalJobSource)
    >>> [job] = list(getUtility(IBranchMergeProposalJobSource).iterReady())
    >>> job.run()

    >>> notifications = pop_notifications()
    >>> notifications = [email for email in notifications if
    ...                  email['X-Launchpad-Message-Rationale'] == 'Owner']
    >>> print_emails(include_reply_to=True, notifications=notifications)
    From: Sender Person <sender@example.com>
    To: ...
    Reply-To: mp+1@code.launchpad.dev
    Subject: Please merge
    Review: Approve db
    This patch is very nice.
    --...
    You are the owner of lp://dev/~...
    ----------------------------------------
    >>> print notifications[0]['X-Launchpad-Branch']
    ~person-name.../product-name.../branch...
    >>> notifications[0]['Message-Id'] == comment.message.rfc822msgid
    True
    >>> (notifications[0]['In-Reply-To'] == merge_proposal.root_message_id)
    True


== Interfaces ==

The CodeReviewComment must implement the ICodeReviewComment interface.

    >>> from lp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from lp.code.interfaces.codereviewcomment import ICodeReviewComment
    >>> verifyObject(ICodeReviewComment, comment)
    True
