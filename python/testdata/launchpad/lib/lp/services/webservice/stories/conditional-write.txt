Conditional writes may work even when the ETags aren't identical
================================================================

This code is tested in lazr.restful, but since it's proven a
longstanding problem in Launchpad, we're giving it a
Launchpad-specific test as well. This will give us a place to start if
the problem crops up again.

Here's a bug: it has an ETag and values for fields like
'date_last_message'.

  >>> url = '/bugs/1'
  >>> bug = webservice.get(url).jsonBody()
  >>> old_etag = bug['http_etag']
  >>> old_date_last_message = bug['date_last_message']

When we add a message to a bug, 'date_last_message' is changed as a
side effect.

  >>> print webservice.named_post(
  ...     url, 'newMessage', subject="subject", content="content")
  HTTP/1.1 201 Created
  ...

  >>> new_bug = webservice.get(url).jsonBody()
  >>> new_date_last_message = new_bug['date_last_message']
  >>> old_date_last_message == new_date_last_message
  False

Because 'date_last_message' changed, the bug resource's ETag also
changed:

  >>> new_etag = new_bug['http_etag']
  >>> old_etag == new_etag
  False

A conditional GET request using the old ETag will fail, and the client
will hear about the new value for 'date_last_message'.

  >>> print webservice.get(url, headers={'If-None-Match' : old_etag})
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...

But what if we want to PATCH the bug object after adding a message?
Logically speaking, the PATCH should go through. 'date_last_message' has
changed, but that's not a field that a client can modify
directly. There's no chance that my PATCH will modify
'date_last_message' in a way that conflicts with someone else's
PATCH. But in general, conditional write requests only succeed if the
client's value for If-Match exactly matches the server-side ETag.

lazr.restful resolves this by splitting the ETag into two parts. The
first part changes only on changes to fields that clients cannot
modify directly, like 'date_last_message':

  >>> old_read, old_write = old_etag.rsplit('-', 1)
  >>> new_read, new_write = new_etag.rsplit('-', 1)
  >>> old_read == new_read
  False

The second part changes only on changes to fields that a client could
modify directly.

  >>> old_write == new_write
  True

So long as the second part of the submitted ETag matches, a
conditional write will succeed.

  >>> import simplejson
  >>> data = simplejson.dumps({'title' : 'New title'})
  >>> headers = {'If-Match': old_etag}
  >>> print webservice.patch(url, 'application/json', data, headers=headers)
  HTTP/1.1 209 Content Returned
  ...

Of course, now the resource has been modified by a client, and the
ETag has changed.

  >>> newer_etag = webservice.get(url).jsonBody()['http_etag']
  >>> newer_read, newer_write = newer_etag.rsplit('-', 1)

Both portions of the ETag has changed: the write portion because we
just changed 'description', and the read portion because
'date_last_updated' changed as a side effect.

  >>> new_read == newer_read
  False
  >>> new_write == newer_write
  False

A conditional write will fail when the write portion of the submitted
ETag doesn't match, even if the read portion matches.

  >>> headers = {'If-Match': new_etag}
  >>> print webservice.patch(url, 'application/json', data, headers=headers)
  HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed
  ...

When two clients attempt overlapping modifications of the same
resource, the later one still gets a 412 error. If an unwritable field
changes, a conditional read will fail, but a conditional write will
succeed, even though the ETags don't match exactly.


It's okay if mod_compress modifies outgoing ETags
=================================================

Here's another way non-identical ETags may be treated as the
same. Apache's mod_compress modifies outgoing ETags when it compresses
the representations. Launchpad's web service will treat an ETag
modified by mod_compress as though it were the original ETag.

  >>> etag = webservice.get(url).jsonBody()['http_etag']

  >>> headers = {'If-None-Match': etag}
  >>> print webservice.get(url, headers=headers)
  HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
  ...

Some versions of mod_compress turn '"foo"' into '"foo"-gzip', and some
versions turn it into '"foo-gzip"'. We treat all three forms the same.

  >>> headers = {'If-None-Match': etag + "-gzip"}
  >>> print webservice.get(url, headers=headers)
  HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
  ...

  >>> headers = {'If-None-Match': etag[:-1] + "-gzip" + etag[-1]}
  >>> print webservice.get(url, headers=headers)
  HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
  ...

Any other modification to the ETag is treated as a distinct ETag.

  >>> headers = {'If-None-Match': etag + "-not-gzip"}
  >>> print webservice.get(url, headers=headers)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
