= A test which reproduces bug 249185 =

Create some teams.

    >>> person = factory.makePerson()
    >>> beta_testers = factory.makeTeam(person)
    >>> devs = factory.makeTeam(person)
    >>> adjutants = factory.makeTeam(person)

    >>> ignored = login_person(person)
    >>> dev1 = factory.makePerson()
    >>> ignored = devs.addMember(dev1, person)

Beta testers has lp-devs and adjutants as members.

    >>> ignored = beta_testers.addMember(devs, person, force_team_add=True)
    >>> ignored = beta_testers.addMember(
    ...     adjutants, person, force_team_add=True)
    >>> dev1.hasParticipationEntryFor(beta_testers)
    True

Adjutants has lp-devs as member.

    >>> ignored = adjutants.addMember(devs, person, force_team_add=True)
    >>> dev1.hasParticipationEntryFor(adjutants)
    True

Members of lp-devs are not direct members in beta-testers but are
participants.

    >>> dev1 in beta_testers.activemembers
    False
    >>> dev1.hasParticipationEntryFor(beta_testers)
    True

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.teammembership import (
    ...     TeamMembershipStatus)
    >>> adjutants.setMembershipData(
    ...     devs, TeamMembershipStatus.DEACTIVATED, person)

lp-devs has left adjutants, so its members are not participants of
adjutants anymore.

    >>> dev1.hasParticipationEntryFor(adjutants)
    False

They should still be participants in beta-testers, though.

    >>> dev1.hasParticipationEntryFor(beta_testers)
    True
