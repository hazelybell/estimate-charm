Distro Arch Series
==================

    >>> from lp.testing import verifyObject

    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.distroarchseriesbinarypackage import (
    ...     IDistroArchSeriesBinaryPackage,
    ...     )
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.publishing import (
    ...     IBinaryPackagePublishingHistory
    ...     )
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.section import ISectionSet

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> hoary = ubuntu.getSeries('hoary')

DistroArchSeries are retrieved via __getitem__:

    >>> hoary_i386 = hoary['i386']

or getDistroArchSeries():

    >>> hoary_hppa = hoary.getDistroArchSeries('hppa')

# XXX: daniels 2005-10-17 bug=3257:
#      This needs many more tests to be effective.


Properties
==========

Enabled is a boolean flag that says whether the arch will receive new builds
and publish them.

    >>> print hoary_i386.enabled
    True

`DistroSeries.enabled_architectures` is a `ResultSet` containing the
architectures with that flag set.

    >>> hoary_i386 in hoary.enabled_architectures
    True
    >>> from lp.testing import celebrity_logged_in
    >>> with celebrity_logged_in('admin'):
    ...     hoary_i386.enabled = False
    >>> hoary_i386 in hoary.enabled_architectures
    False


DistroArchSeries can tell you about their published releases
============================================================

DistroArchSeries has a number of releases of any given binary
package in them. This can be due to various reasons such as uploads in
progress, superseding in progress, or simply that there is more than
one version spread across the pockets. getReleasedPackages lets us
interrogate this information.

    >>> for p in hoary_i386.getReleasedPackages("pmount"):
    ...     print p.binarypackagerelease.binarypackagename.name
    pmount

See more information about getReleasePackages below.

Check the behavior of the provided search method, which returns a
list of IDARBPR instances containing the matching packages.

    >>> results = hoary_i386.searchBinaryPackages(text=u'pmount')
    >>> results.count()
    1
    >>> pmount = results[0]

The method works even when we are searching for packages whose names are
not fti-matchable, such as "linux-2.6.12", and substrings:

    >>> warty = ubuntu.getSeries('warty')
    >>> warty_i386 = warty['i386']
    >>> results = warty_i386.searchBinaryPackages(text=u'linux-2.6.12')
    >>> results.count()
    1
    >>> results = warty_i386.searchBinaryPackages(text=u'a')
    >>> for dasbp in results:
    ...     print "%s: %s" % (dasbp.__class__.__name__, dasbp.name)
    DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease: at
    DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease: mozilla-firefox
    DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease: mozilla-firefox
    DistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease: mozilla-firefox-data

    # XXX cprov 2006-03-21: Broken implementation, missing enhances attribute.
    verifyObject(IDistroArchSeriesBinaryPackageRelease, pmount)
    True

Check IDARBP provider

    >>> pmount_hoary_i386 = hoary_i386.getBinaryPackage('pmount')

    >>> verifyObject(IDistroArchSeriesBinaryPackage, pmount_hoary_i386)
    True

    >>> pmount_hoary_i386.name
    u'pmount'


Check some properties of DARBP meta class

Entire publishing history:

    >>> pmount_hoary_i386.publishing_history.count()
    2

Most recent published history row:

    >>> bpph = pmount_hoary_i386.current_published

    # XXX cprov 2006-03-22: The object doesn't pass verifyObject()
    # due the lack of distroarchseriesbinarypackagerelease attribute.

    >>> IBinaryPackagePublishingHistory.providedBy(bpph)
    True

    >>> bpph.section.name
    u'editors'

Perform `post publication` override:

    >>> new_section = getUtility(ISectionSet)['base']
    >>> version = bpph.binarypackagerelease.version
    >>> pmount_hoary_i386_released = pmount_hoary_i386[version]

    >>> from lp.testing import person_logged_in
    >>> pmount_i386_pub = pmount_hoary_i386_released.current_publishing_record
    >>> with person_logged_in(ubuntu.main_archive.owner):
    ...     override = pmount_i386_pub.changeOverride(
    ...         new_section=new_section)
    >>> override.section == new_section
    True
    >>> override.status.name
    'PENDING'
    >>> pub_hist = pmount_hoary_i386.publishing_history
    >>> pub_hist.count()
    3

Override information about 'pmount' is pending publication:

    >>> pub_hist[0].status.name, pub_hist[0].section.name
    ('PENDING', u'base')

Supersede current publication:

    >>> pub = pmount_hoary_i386_released.current_publishing_record
    >>> pub.supersede()
    >>> pmount_hoary_i386.publishing_history.count()
    3

    >>> print pub.status.name, pub.datesuperseded is not None
    SUPERSEDED True


Binary publishing lookups
=========================

IDistroArchseries allows binary publishing lookup via
getReleasedPackages method which returns a shortlist of
IBinaryPackagePublishingHistory ordered by descending ID.

In order to test its behavior we will create a bunch of sample
publishing records with different (status, pocket, archive) in
ubuntu/breezy-autotest/i386, which is empty:

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.pocket import PackagePublishingPocket
    >>> from lp.soyuz.model.publishing import (
    ...     BinaryPackagePublishingHistory)

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> breezy_autotest = ubuntu['breezy-autotest']
    >>> bt_i386 = breezy_autotest['i386']
    >>> cprov_archive = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('cprov').archive

We will use a 'at' binarypackage because it's not published yet in the
architecture we want to test, this will help to make the tests as clear
as possible.

    >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
    >>> at_warty_i386 = warty['i386'].getBinaryPackage('at')
    >>> sample_bpr = at_warty_i386.currentrelease.binarypackagerelease

    >>> BinaryPackagePublishingHistory.selectBy(
    ...     distroarchseries=bt_i386, binarypackagerelease=sample_bpr).count()
    0

Create and collect several binary publishing records in a variety of
states, pockets and archives:

    >>> from lp.soyuz.tests.soyuz import SoyuzTestHelper

    >>> soyuz_helper = SoyuzTestHelper()
    >>> sample_pub = soyuz_helper.createPublishingForDistroArchSeries(
    ...      sample_bpr, bt_i386)

    >>> [pub_main_release_pending, pub_main_release_published,
    ...  pub_main_updates_pending, pub_main_proposed_published,
    ...  pub_ppa_release_pending, pub_ppa_release_published,
    ...  pub_ppa_updates_pending, pub_ppa_proposed_published] = sample_pub

Looking for all PUBLISHED publications in main_archive and all
pockets:

    >>> all_published_main_pubs = [
    ...     pub_main_proposed_published,
    ...     pub_main_release_published,
    ...     ]

    >>> import operator
    >>> all_published_main_pubs = sorted(
    ...    all_published_main_pubs, key=operator.attrgetter('id'),
    ...    reverse=True)

    >>> result = bt_i386.getReleasedPackages('at')
    >>> soyuz_helper.checkPubList(all_published_main_pubs, result)
    True

Looking for all PUBLISHED or PENDING publications in main_archive and all
pockets.

    >>> all_main_pubs = [
    ...     pub_main_proposed_published,
    ...     pub_main_updates_pending,
    ...     pub_main_release_published,
    ...     pub_main_release_pending,
    ...     ]

    >>> all_main_pubs = sorted(
    ...    all_main_pubs, key=operator.attrgetter('id'),
    ...    reverse=True)

    >>> result = bt_i386.getReleasedPackages('at', include_pending=True)
    >>> soyuz_helper.checkPubList(all_main_pubs, result)
    True

Using 'pocket' filter:

    >>> updates_main_pubs = [
    ...     pub_main_updates_pending,
    ...     ]

    >>> result = bt_i386.getReleasedPackages(
    ...     'at', include_pending=True,
    ...     pocket=PackagePublishingPocket.UPDATES)

    >>> soyuz_helper.checkPubList(updates_main_pubs, result)
    True

Looking for all PUBLISHED or PENDING publications in cprov PPA and all
pockets.

    >>> all_ppa_pubs = [
    ...     pub_ppa_proposed_published,
    ...     pub_ppa_updates_pending,
    ...     pub_ppa_release_published,
    ...     pub_ppa_release_pending,
    ...     ]

    >>> all_ppa_pubs = sorted(
    ...    all_ppa_pubs, key=operator.attrgetter('id'), reverse=True)

    >>> result = bt_i386.getReleasedPackages(
    ...    'at', include_pending=True, archive=cprov_archive)
    >>> soyuz_helper.checkPubList(all_ppa_pubs, result)
    True

DistroArchSeries Lookup
=======================

The architectures related to a specific distroseries can be retrieved
via the 'architectures' property.

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
    >>> hoary = ubuntu['hoary']

    >>> def print_architectures(architectures):
    ...     for arch in architectures:
    ...         result = arch.title
    ...         if arch.official or arch.supports_virtualized:
    ...             result += ' ('
    ...         if arch.official:
    ...             result += 'official'
    ...             if arch.supports_virtualized:
    ...                 result += ', '
    ...         if arch.supports_virtualized:
    ...             result += 'ppa'
    ...         if arch.official or arch.supports_virtualized:
    ...             result += ')'
    ...         print result

    >>> print_architectures(warty.architectures)
    The Warty Warthog Release for hppa (hppa)
    The Warty Warthog Release for i386 (386) (official, ppa)

DistroArchSeries for which we support PPA building can be obtained via
another distroseries method called 'virtualized_architectures'.

For testing purposes we can compare the results of a
manually-calculated set of warty architectures for which we support
PPA  and the actual value returned from the 'ppa_architecture'
property.

    >>> expected_ppa_archs = [arch for arch in warty.architectures
    ...                       if arch.supports_virtualized is True]
    >>> print_architectures(expected_ppa_archs)
    The Warty Warthog Release for i386 (386) (official, ppa)

    >>> print_architectures(warty.virtualized_architectures)
    The Warty Warthog Release for i386 (386) (official, ppa)

Let's activate ppa support for hoary/hppa and check if
'virtualized_architectures' will include it this time.

    >>> print_architectures(hoary.virtualized_architectures)
    The Hoary Hedgehog Release for i386 (386) (official, ppa)

    >>> from lp.services.database.sqlbase import flush_database_updates
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

    >>> hoary['hppa'].supports_virtualized = True
    >>> flush_database_updates()

    >>> print_architectures(hoary.virtualized_architectures)
    The Hoary Hedgehog Release for hppa (hppa) (ppa)
    The Hoary Hedgehog Release for i386 (386) (official, ppa)

There is also `DistroSeries.buildable_architectures` which returns a
`ResultSet` containing only the `DistroArchSeries` with available
chroots tarballs (the ones for which we can build packages).

In the sampledata, none of the hoary architectures have chroot
tarballs. Once it is available the corresponding architecture is
returned.

    >>> hoary.buildable_architectures.count()
    0

    # Create a chroot tarball for hoary/hppa.
    >>> chroot = factory.makeLibraryFileAlias()
    >>> unused = hoary.getDistroArchSeries('hppa').addOrUpdateChroot(chroot)

    >>> print_architectures(hoary.buildable_architectures)
    The Hoary Hedgehog Release for hppa (hppa) (ppa)

The architecture also has a 'chroot_url' attribute directly referencing
the file.

    >>> print hoary.getDistroArchSeries('hppa').chroot_url
    http://.../filename...
    >>> hoary.getDistroArchSeries('hppa').chroot_url == \
    ...     chroot.http_url
    True

If there is no chroot, chroot_url will be None.

    >>> print hoary.getDistroArchSeries('i386').chroot_url
    None

`DistroSeries.buildable_architectures` results are ordered
alphabetically by 'architecturetag'.

    # Create a chroot tarball for hoary/i386.
    >>> unused = hoary.getDistroArchSeries('i386').addOrUpdateChroot(chroot)

    >>> print_architectures(hoary.buildable_architectures)
    The Hoary Hedgehog Release for hppa (hppa) (ppa)
    The Hoary Hedgehog Release for i386 (386) (official, ppa)
