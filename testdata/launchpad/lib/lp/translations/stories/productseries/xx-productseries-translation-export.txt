= Exporting ProductSeries Translations Through the Web =

Launchpad supports export of entire productseries translations in a single
tarball.  Meant primarily for upstream maintainers, the tarball will contain
all templates for the product series as well as all their translations.


== Where to request ==

Any authenticated user can request a tarball export for a productseries.  The
option is presented in the sidebar as "Download translations" on the
productseries' translations page.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk/')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('download').click()
    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk/+export

Another way of getting there is by going to the product's +translate page.
It will select a series of the product as its primary translation target, and
offer a download link for that series.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/+translations')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('download').click()
    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk/+export


== Anonymous access ==

To prevent spambot activity from becoming a problem, the download option is
not available to anonymous visitors.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk/')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('download')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError


== Making the request ==

The logged-in user sees a page that lets them select an export format, and
request the download.

    >>> print user_browser.title
    Download : Translations...


=== File format ===

The request must specify a file format.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Format:').clear() 
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Request Download').click()

    >>> print_feedback_messages(user_browser.contents)
    Please select a valid format for download.

The most usual and most well-supported format is PO.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Format:').value = ['PO']
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Request Download').click()

    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk

    >>> print_feedback_messages(user_browser.contents)
    Your request has been received. Expect to receive an email shortly.

An alternative is MO.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('download').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Format:').value = ['PO']
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Request Download').click()
    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://translations.launchpad.dev/evolution/trunk

    >>> print_feedback_messages(user_browser.contents)
    Your request has been received. Expect to receive an email shortly.


=== Nothing to export ===

Where there are no translation files to be exported, the user is not offered
the option to download any.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://translations.launchpad.dev/bzr/trunk/+export')
    >>> print_feedback_messages(user_browser.contents)
    There are no translations to download in Bazaar trunk series.

On +translate pages for products that do not have any translations, the action
link for "Download translations" is hidden.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://translations.launchpad.dev/bzr/')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('download')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError
