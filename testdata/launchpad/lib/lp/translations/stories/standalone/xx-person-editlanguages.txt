Carlos is a translator who translates things into Spanish with Rosetta.
He comes to the main Translations page and wants to change his preferred
languages.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic carlos@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://translations.launchpad.dev/')

So he looks for the "preferred languages" section on the page.  This
lists his current preferences.

    >>> def find_languages_section(page):
    ...     """Return the preferred-languages section on page as text."""
    ...     tag = find_tag_by_id(page, 'preferred-languages')
    ...     return extract_text(tag)

    >>> print find_languages_section(browser.contents)
    Your preferred languages
    Catalan
    Spanish
    &... Change your preferred languages...

The 'Change your preferred languages' link takes him to his
+editlanguages page.

    >>> browser.getLink(id="change-languages").click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents).find('h1'))
    Your language preferences

So far, he has Spanish selected as one of his preferred languages, but
not Welsh. English is checked but it is not a translatable language.

    >>> browser.getControl('Catalan').selected
    True
    >>> browser.getControl('Spanish').selected
    True
    >>> browser.getControl('Welsh').selected
    False
    >>> browser.getControl('English', index=0).selected
    True

Now let's suppose that Carlos decides that he doesn't like Spanish
after all, and that Welsh is a much nicer language. When he adjusts
his preferences, Spanish will no longer be selected, and Welsh will.

    >>> browser.getControl('Spanish').selected = False
    >>> browser.getControl('Welsh').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Save').click()

After he submits the form, he should again be redirected back to
Rosetta's About page. The 'Your preferred languages' portlet displays
his two translatable languages. The page also displays two messages
confirming his changes.

    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print message.renderContents()
    Added Welsh to your preferred languages.<br
    />Removed Spanish from your preferred languages.

    >>> browser.open('http://translations.launchpad.dev/')
    >>> print find_languages_section(browser.contents)
    Your preferred languages
    Catalan
    Welsh
    &...

Joao, a Brazilian, travels to Liechtenstein for business and views the
languages page from there.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser('Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> # Fake request from a Liechtenstein IP address by setting
    >>> # X-Forwarded-For in the http header, like a proxy would.
    >>> browser.addHeader('X-Forwarded-For', '80.66.224.0')
    >>> browser.addHeader('Accept-Language', 'pt_br, Espa\xf1ol')
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://translations.launchpad.dev/~name12/+editlanguages')

Since Joao doesn't have a preferred language set, Launchpad determines
it from the browser headers.  His secondary language choice, Spanish, is
misconfigured (the language name is not spelled in proper UTF-8) but the
pt_br language code is recognized properly.

    >>> portlet = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'portlet-browser-languages')
    >>> print extract_text(portlet)
    Your browser languages:
    Portuguese (Brazil)

Launchpad detects that the requesting IP address (80.66.224.0) is in a
range assigned to Liechtenstein.

    >>> country_portlet = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents,
    ...                                  'portlet-country-languages')
    >>> print extract_text(country_portlet.dt)
    Languages in Liechtenstein

The system has no information about languages spoken in Liechtenstein,
so instead Joao is shown how to provide the administrators with this
information.

    >>> def find_spoken_languages(spoken_in):
    ...     """Screen-scrape list of "spoken-in" languages out of html."""
    ...     list_items = find_tags_by_class(str(spoken_in), 'language')
    ...     return [li.contents for li in list_items]

    >>> print find_spoken_languages(country_portlet)
    []
    >>> print country_portlet.first('a')['href']
    http://answers.launchpad.dev/launchpad

Back home in Brazil, Joao gets the equivalent for Brazil, where the
equivalent information is known.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser('Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.addHeader('X-Forwarded-For', '143.54.0.1')
    >>> browser.open(
    ...     'http://translations.launchpad.dev/~name12/+editlanguages')
    >>> country_portlet = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents,
    ...                                  'portlet-country-languages')
    >>> print find_spoken_languages(country_portlet)
    [[u'Portuguese (Brazil)']]

We also have a page under the launchpad root, called +editmylanguages,
with launchpad.AnyPerson as permission. This is the page to which we
direct non-logged in users to edit their preferred languages.

The launchpad.AnyPerson permission means that when an anonymous user goes
to that page, they'll be asked to login.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+editmylanguages')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ...

But a logged in user will be sent straight to their /~user/+editlanguages
page.

    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+editmylanguages')
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~name12/+editlanguages'


== Adding languages to teams ==

Team admins may set their team's preferred languages to select the
which languages they support in the Answer Tracker. Sample Person
is the admin for Landscape Developers. He decides he wants the team
to support Spanish questions for Ubuntu, so he sets the team's
preferred languages.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~landscape-developers')
    >>> browser.title
    'Landscape Developers in Launchpad'

    >>> browser.getLink('Set preferred languages').click()
    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(browser.contents).find('h1'))
    Landscape Developers's language preferences

    >>> browser.getControl('Spanish').selected = True
    >>> browser.getControl('Save').click()
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    Added Spanish to Landscape Developers&#x27;s preferred languages.


== Admins may set a Person's languages ==

Admins can change a user's language settings if needed. Foo Bar, a
Launchpad Admin has a question from No Privileges Person claiming that
he cannot add Esperanto to his languages. Foo Bar visits No Privileges
Person's page to do it himself.

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv')
    >>> admin_browser.title
    'No Privileges Person in Launchpad'
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Set preferred languages').click()
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_main_content(admin_browser.contents).find('h1'))
    No Privileges Person's language preferences

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Esperanto').selected = True
    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Save').click()
    >>> for message in find_tags_by_class(admin_browser.contents, 'message'):
    ...     print extract_text(message)
    Added Esperanto to No Privileges Person&#x27;s preferred languages.


The personal page nags
----------------------

If you don't have your preferred languages set, your Translations home
page will nag you about it.

    >>> def find_nag(browser):
    ...     """Return the nag message as shown in browser, if present."""
    ...     tag = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'no-languages')
    ...     if tag:
    ...         return tag.renderContents()
    ...     else:
    ...         return None

Noi, a new user, visits her home page.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> noi = factory.makePerson(name='noi', email='noi@example.com')
    >>> logout()

    >>> noi_browser = setupBrowser('Basic noi@example.com:test')
    >>> noi_home = 'http://translations.launchpad.dev/~noi'
    >>> noi_browser.open(noi_home)

The home page reminds her to set her preferred languages.

    >>> print find_nag(noi_browser)
    You have not selected your preferred languages.
    Please <a ...>set them now</a>.

The message does not appear for other users looking at Noi's home page.

    >>> user_browser.open(noi_home)
    >>> print find_nag(user_browser)
    None

The nag message links to the languages editing page.

    >>> noi_browser.getLink(id='set-languages').click()
    >>> print noi_browser.title
    Language preferences...

Once Noi has set one or more preferred languages, the nag message goes
away.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> from lp.services.worlddata.model.language import LanguageSet
    >>> noi.addLanguage(LanguageSet().getLanguageByCode('lo'))
    >>> logout()

    >>> noi_browser.open(noi_home)
    >>> print find_nag(noi_browser)
    None
