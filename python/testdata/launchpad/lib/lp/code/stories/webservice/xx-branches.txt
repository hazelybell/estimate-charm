= The set of branches =

The set of branches in Launchpad is represented by the collection found at
/branches. By default it lists the 50 most recently changed branches.

    >>> branches = webservice.get('/branches').jsonBody()
    >>> len(branches['entries'])
    1


== Custom operations ==

The branches collection also offers operations to get a particular branch.

    >>> from lp.code.enums import BranchType
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> branch = factory.makeAnyBranch(branch_type=BranchType.MIRRORED)
    >>> branch_url = branch.url
    >>> branch_unique_name = branch.unique_name
    >>> branch2 = factory.makeAnyBranch()
    >>> branch2_url = branch2.bzr_identity
    >>> branch2_unique_name = branch2.unique_name
    >>> logout()


=== Getting a branch by URL ===

    >>> found_branch = webservice.get(
    ...     '/branches?ws.op=getByUrl&url=%s' % branch_url).jsonBody()
    >>> found_branch['unique_name'] == branch_unique_name
    True


=== Getting many branches by URL ===

The branches collection has a helper to get a lot of branches at once. This
saves roundtrips and provides potential performance improvements.

    >>> doesnt_exist = 'http://example.com/doesntexist'
    >>> branches = webservice.get(
    ...     '/branches?ws.op=getByUrls&urls=%s&urls=%s&urls=%s'
    ...     % (branch_url, doesnt_exist, branch2_url))
    >>> branches = branches.jsonBody()

We gave three URLs, so we get back a dict with three branches.

    >>> print len(branches)
    3

The URL that refers to a branch that doesn't exist maps to None.

    >>> print branches[doesnt_exist]
    None

The URLs that refer to real, honest-to-goodness existing branches map to those
branches:

    >>> print branches[branch_url]['unique_name'] == branch_unique_name
    True
    >>> print branches[branch2_url]['unique_name'] == branch2_unique_name
    True
