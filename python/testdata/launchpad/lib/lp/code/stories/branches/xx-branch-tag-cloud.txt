Projects with active branches
=============================

The tag cloud of projects is one way in which the number and scope of available
bazaar branches is shown to the user.

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> from lp.code.tests.helpers import make_project_cloud_data
    >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    >>> import pytz
    >>> now = datetime.now(pytz.UTC)
    >>> make_project_cloud_data(factory, [
    ...     ('wibble', 35, 2, now - timedelta(days=2)),
    ...     ('linux', 110, 1, now - timedelta(days=8)),
    ...     ])
    >>> logout()

    >>> anon_browser.open("http://code.launchpad.dev/projects")
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    Projects with active branches

The `Projects with active branches` page shows a link for each project that has
branches associated with it.  The HTML class attribute is used to control how
the link is shown.

    >>> tags = find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'project-tags')
    >>> for anchor in tags.fetch('a'):
    ...     print anchor.renderContents(), anchor['class']
    linux cloud-size-largest cloud-medium
    wibble cloud-size-smallest cloud-dark
