= Message sharing merge script =

The message-sharing-merge.py script turns legacy, pre-message-sharing
translations into properly sharing ones.

Unit tests go through the details of how the script works.  Here we just
show that the script can run and perform its work.

    >>> from lp.services.scripts.tests import run_script
    >>> retcode, stdout, stderr = run_script(
    ...     'scripts/rosetta/message-sharing-merge.py', [
    ...         '-q', '-P', '-T', '-d', 'ubuntu', '-s', 'evolution'])

The migration succeeds.

    >>> retcode
    0


# The script modified the database, even though the database layer may
# not have noticed it.

    >>> from lp.testing.layers import DatabaseLayer
    >>> DatabaseLayer.force_dirty_database()
