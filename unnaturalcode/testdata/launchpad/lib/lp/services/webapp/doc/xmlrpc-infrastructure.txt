= XMLRPC infrastructure =

When you write XMLRPC view classes, you should extend the base class
LaunchpadXMLRPCView.

    >>> from lp.services.webapp import LaunchpadXMLRPCView
    >>> viewobj = LaunchpadXMLRPCView('somecontext', 'somerequest')

You get access to the context and the request, as you would expect.

    >>> viewobj.context
    'somecontext'
    >>> viewobj.request
    'somerequest'

Like a LaunchpadView, you can get 'self.user', which is the currently logged-in
user, or None when there is no user logged in.

    >>> viewobj.user is None
    True
