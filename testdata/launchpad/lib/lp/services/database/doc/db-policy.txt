Storm Stores & Database Policies
================================

Launchpad has multiple master and slave databases. Changes to data are
made on the master and replicated asynchronously to the slave
databases. Slave databases will usually lag a few seconds behind their
master. Under high load they may lag a few minutes behind, during
maintenance they may lag a few hours behind and if things explode
while admins are on holiday they may lag days behind.

If know your code needs to change data, or must have the latest posible
information, you retrieve objects from the master databases that stores
the data for your database class.

    >>> from lp.services.database.interfaces import IMasterStore
    >>> from lp.registry.model.person import Person
    >>> import transaction

    >>> writable_janitor = IMasterStore(Person).find(
    ...     Person, Person.name == 'janitor').one()

    >>> writable_janitor.displayname = 'Jack the Janitor'
    >>> transaction.commit()

Sometimes though we know we will not make changes and don't care much
if the information is a little out of date. In these cases you should
explicitly retrieve objects from a slave.

The more agressively we retrieve objects from slave databases instead
of the master, the better the overall performance of Launchpad will be.
We can distribute this load over many slave databases but are limited to
a single master.

    >>> from lp.services.database.interfaces import ISlaveStore
    >>> ro_janitor = ISlaveStore(Person).find(
    ...     Person, Person.name == 'janitor').one()
    >>> ro_janitor is writable_janitor
    False

    >>> ro_janitor.displayname = 'Janice the Janitor'
    >>> transaction.commit()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InternalError: ...

    >>> transaction.abort()

Much of our code does not know if the objects being retrieved need to be
updatable to or have to be absolutely up to date. In this case, we
retrieve objects from the default store. What object being returned
depends on the currently installed database policy.

    >>> from lp.services.database.interfaces import IStore
    >>> default_janitor = IStore(Person).find(
    ...     Person, Person.name == 'janitor').one()
    >>> default_janitor is writable_janitor
    True

As you can see, the default database policy retrieves objects from
the master database. This allows our code written before database
replication was implemented to keep working.

To alter this behavior, you can install a different database policy.

    >>> from lp.services.database.policy import SlaveDatabasePolicy
    >>> with SlaveDatabasePolicy():
    ...     default_janitor = IStore(Person).find(
    ...         Person, Person.name == 'janitor').one()
    >>> default_janitor is writable_janitor
    False

The database policy can also affect what happens when objects are
explicitly retrieved from a slave or master database. For example,
if we have code that needs to run during database maintenance or
code we want to prove only accesses slave database resources, we can
raise an exception if an attempt is made to access master database
resources.

    >>> from lp.services.database.policy import (
    ...     SlaveOnlyDatabasePolicy)
    >>> with SlaveOnlyDatabasePolicy():
    ...     whoops = IMasterStore(Person).find(
    ...         Person, Person.name == 'janitor').one()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    DisallowedStore: master

We can even ensure no database activity occurs at all, for instance
if we need to guarantee a potentially long running call doesn't access
the database at all starting a new and potentially long running
database transaction.

    >>> from lp.services.database.policy import DatabaseBlockedPolicy
    >>> with DatabaseBlockedPolicy():
    ...     whoops = IStore(Person).find(
    ...         Person, Person.name == 'janitor').one()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    DisallowedStore: ('main', 'default')

Database policies can also be installed and uninstalled using the
IStoreSelector utility for cases where the 'with' syntax cannot
be used.

    >>> from lp.services.database.interfaces import IStoreSelector
    >>> getUtility(IStoreSelector).push(SlaveDatabasePolicy())
    >>> try:
    ...     default_janitor = IStore(Person).find(
    ...         Person, Person.name == 'janitor').one()
    ... finally:
    ...     db_policy = getUtility(IStoreSelector).pop()
    >>> default_janitor is ro_janitor
    True

Casting
-------

If you need to change an object you have a read only copy of, or are
unsure if the object is writable or not, you can easily cast it
to a writable copy. This is a noop if the object is already writable
so is good defensive programming.

    >>> from lp.services.database.interfaces import IMasterObject
    >>> IMasterObject(ro_janitor) is writable_janitor
    True
