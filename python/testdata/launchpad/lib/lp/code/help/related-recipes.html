    <p>
      You can ask Launchpad to make an automatic daily build
      of the code in this branch and place the resultant package(s)
      in your chosen PPA. (<a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/SourceBuilds" target="_blank">Read more</a>)
    </p>

    <p>A "recipe" is a description of the steps Launchpad's package builder
      should take to construct a source package from a set of Bazaar branches
      that you specify.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using a recipe, you tell Launchpad:
    </p>
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>in which branch to find the code</li>
      <li>where to find the packaging information &mdash; e.g. in a separate
      branch or in an existing Ubuntu package branch</li>
      <li>the correct package version (so users will still be able to upgrade
      to the stable version of the distro once it gets released)</li>
      <li>any modifications necessary to make the source build properly</li>
    </ul>
