# XXX BarryWarsaw 2008-02-12:
# Things this script does NOT do correctly.
#
# - Fix up the deactivated lists.  This isn't done because that data lives in
#   the backed up tar file, so handling this would mean untar'ing, tricking
#   Mailman into loading the pickle (or manually loading and patching), then
#   re-tar'ing.  I don't think it's worth it because the only thing that will
#   be broken is if a list that's deactivated on production is re-activated on
#   staging.
#
# - Backpatch all the message footers and RFC 2369 headers of the messages in
#   the archive.  To do this, we'd have to iterate through all messages,
#   tweaking the List-* headers (easy) and ripping apart the footers,
#   recalculating them and reattaching them (difficult).  Doing the iteration
#   and update is quite painful in Python 2.4, but would be easier with Python
#   2.5's new mailbox module.  /Then/ we'd have to regenerate the archives.
#   Not doing this means that some of the links in staging's MHonArc archive
#   will point to production archives.
