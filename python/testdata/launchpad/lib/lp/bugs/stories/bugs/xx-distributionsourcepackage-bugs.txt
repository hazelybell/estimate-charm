= Distribution Source Package Bugs =

This page is like most bug listing pages, but it also has a portlet
"portlet-publishing-details" giving information about the latest published
versions in each distroseries it's published in.

The portlet itself is demonstrated in
pagtests/soyuz/xx-portlet-publishing-details.  Here, we just show that it
is present on the page.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/+source/alsa-utils/')
    >>> portlet = find_portlet(anon_browser.contents,
    ...     '"alsa-utils" versions published in Ubuntu')
    >>> print portlet
    <div class="portlet" id="portlet-publishing-details">
    ...
