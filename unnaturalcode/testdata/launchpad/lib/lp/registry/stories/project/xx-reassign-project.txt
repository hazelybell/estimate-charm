  Change the owner of the mozilla project.


  Logged in as no-priv@canonical.com we can't do that, because he's not the
  owner of the project nor a member of admins.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /mozilla/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic no-priv@canonical.com:test
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
  ...


  Now we're logged in as mark@example.com and he's the owner of the admins team,
  so he can do everything.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /mozilla/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic mark@example.com:test
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  ...Current:...
  ...
  ...New:...
  ...


  Here he changes the owner to himself.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... POST /mozilla/+reassign HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic mark@example.com:test
  ... Referer: https://launchpad.dev/
  ...
  ... field.owner=mark&field.existing=existing"""
  ... r"""&field.actions.change=Change""")
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other

  Here we see the new owner: Mark Shuttleworth

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /mozilla/ HTTP/1.1
  ... Authorization: Basic mark@example.com:test
