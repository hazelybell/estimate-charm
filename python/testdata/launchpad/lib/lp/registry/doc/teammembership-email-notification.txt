Mail notifications for membership changes
=========================================

Whenever a membership status is changed, we should notify the team
admins and the member whose membership changed. There's a few cases
where we might want to notify only the team admins, but in most of the
cases we'll be sending two similar (but not identical) notifications:
one for all team admins and another for the member.

    >>> def by_to_addrs(a, b):
    ...     return cmp(a[1], b[1])

    >>> def setStatus(membership, status, reviewer=None, comment=None,
    ...               silent=False):
    ...     """Set the status of the given membership.
    ...
    ...     Also sets the reviewer and comment, calling flush_database_updates
    ...     and transaction.commit after, to ensure the changes are flushed to
    ...     the database.
    ...     """
    ...     membership.setStatus(status, reviewer, comment=comment,
    ...         silent=silent)
    ...     flush_database_updates()
    ...     transaction.commit()

    >>> from lp.services.mail import stub
    >>> from lp.testing.mail_helpers import (
    ...     pop_notifications, print_distinct_emails, run_mail_jobs)

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import (
    ...     IPersonSet,
    ...     TeamMembershipRenewalPolicy,
    ...     TeamMembershipPolicy,
    ...     )
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.teammembership import (
    ...     ITeamMembershipSet,
    ...     TeamMembershipStatus,
    ...     )
    >>> personset = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> membershipset = getUtility(ITeamMembershipSet)
    >>> mark = personset.getByName('mark')
    >>> kamion = personset.getByName('kamion')
    >>> sampleperson = personset.getByName('name12')
    >>> ubuntu_team = personset.getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> open_team = factory.makeTeam(
    ...     membership_policy=TeamMembershipPolicy.OPEN)
    >>> from lp.testing.sampledata import ADMIN_EMAIL
    >>> admin_person = personset.getByEmail(ADMIN_EMAIL)

In open teams joining and leaving the team generates no notifications.

    >>> ignored = login_person(admin_person)
    >>> base_mails = len(stub.test_emails)
    >>> new_person = factory.makePerson()
    >>> ignored = login_person(new_person)
    >>> new_person.join(open_team)
    >>> membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(new_person, open_team)
    >>> membership.status.title
    'Approved'

    >>> run_mail_jobs()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails) - base_mails
    0

    >>> new_person.leave(open_team)
    >>> run_mail_jobs()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails) - base_mails
    0

Now Robert Collins proposes himself as a member of the Ubuntu Team. This
generates a notification email only to Ubuntu Team administrators.

    >>> lifeless = personset.getByName('lifeless')
    >>> ignored = login_person(lifeless)
    >>> lifeless.join(ubuntu_team)
    >>> membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(lifeless, ubuntu_team)

    Robert Collins (lifeless) wants to be a member of Ubuntu Team (ubuntu-

Declining a proposed member should generate notifications for both the
member and each of the team's admins.

    # Need to be logged in as a team admin to be able to change memberships of
    # that team.

    >>> login('mark@example.com')
    >>> setStatus(membership, TeamMembershipStatus.DECLINED, reviewer=mark)

addMember() has queued up a job to send out the emails. We'll run the

Team admins can propose their teams using the join() method as well, but
in that case we'll use the requester's (the person proposing the team as
the other's member) email address in the 'Reply-To' header of the
message sent.

    >>> admins = personset.getByName('admins')

Adding new members
------------------

When a person is added as a member of a team by one of that team's
administrators, an email is sent to all team administrators and to the
new member.

    >>> cprov = personset.getByName('cprov')
    >>> marilize = personset.getByName('marilize')
    >>> ignored = ubuntu_team.addMember(marilize, reviewer=cprov)
    >>> run_mail_jobs()

Now, the emails have been sent.

    >>> len(stub.test_emails)

      ...

    ----------------------------------------

By default, if the newly added member is actually a team, we'll only
send an invitation to the team's admins, telling them that the
membership will only be activated if they accept the invitation.

    >>> mirror_admins = personset.getByName('ubuntu-mirror-admins')
    >>> mirror_admins.getTeamAdminsEmailAddresses()
    ['mark@example.com']

    >>> ignored = ubuntu_team.addMember(mirror_admins, reviewer=cprov)
    >>> run_mail_jobs()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    1

    >>> print_distinct_emails()
    From: Ubuntu Team <noreply@launchpad.net>
    To: mark@example.com
    Subject: Invitation for ubuntu-mirror-admins to join
    <BLANKLINE>
    Celso Providelo (cprov) has invited Mirror Administrators (ubuntu-

    <http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team>
    <BLANKLINE>
    You can accept or decline this invitation on the following page:

        http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-mirror-admins/+invitation/ubuntu-team
    <BLANKLINE>
    Regards,
    The Launchpad team
    ----------------------------------------

If one of the admins accept the invitation, then a notification is sent
to the team which just became a member and to the admins of the hosting
team.

    >>> comment = "Of course I want to be part of ubuntu!"
    >>> mirror_admins.acceptInvitationToBeMemberOf(ubuntu_team, comment)

    Mark Shuttleworth said:

    ----------------------------------------

Similarly, a notification is sent if the invitation is declined.

    >>> landscape = personset.getByName('landscape-developers')
    >>> ignored = ubuntu_team.addMember(landscape, reviewer=cprov)

    # Reset stub.test_emails as we don't care about the notification triggered
    # by the addMember() call.

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> stub.test_emails = []

    >>> comment = "Landscape has nothing to do with ubuntu, unfortunately."

    ----------------------------------------

It's also possible to forcibly add a team as a member of another one, by
passing force_team_add=True to the addMember() method.

    >>> launchpad = personset.getByName('launchpad')
    >>> ignored = ubuntu_team.addMember(
    ...     launchpad, reviewer=cprov, force_team_add=True)
    >>> flush_database_updates()

    ----------------------------------------


Membership expiration warnings
------------------------------

When we get close to the expiration date of a given membership, an
expiration warning is sent to the member, so that he can contact the
team's administrators (or renew it himself when he has necessary rights)
in case he wants to retain that membership. This is done by the flag-
expired-memberships cronscript, which uses
ITeamMembership.sendExpirationWarningEmail to do its job.

    >>> import pytz
    >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    >>> utc_now = datetime.now(pytz.timezone('UTC'))

In the case of the beta-testers team, the email is sent only to the
team's owner, which doesn't have the necessary rights to renew the
membership of his team, so he's instructed to contact one of the ubuntu-
team's admins.

    >>> beta_testers = personset.getByName('launchpad-beta-testers')
    >>> beta_testers_on_ubuntu_team = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     beta_testers, ubuntu_team)
    >>> beta_testers_on_ubuntu_team.setExpirationDate(
    ...     utc_now + timedelta(days=9), mark)
    >>> flush_database_updates()
    >>> beta_testers_on_ubuntu_team.sendExpirationWarningEmail()
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> print_distinct_emails()
    From: Ubuntu Team <noreply@launchpad.net>
    To: beta-admin@launchpad.net
    Subject: launchpad-beta-testers will expire soon from ubuntu-team
    <BLANKLINE>
    On ..., 9 days from now, the membership
    of Launchpad Beta Testers (launchpad-beta-testers) (which you are
    the owner of) in the Ubuntu Team (ubuntu-team) Launchpad team
    is due to expire.
    <http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team>
    <BLANKLINE>
    To prevent this membership from expiring, you should get in touch
    with one of the team's administrators:
    Alexander Limi (limi) <http://launchpad.dev/~limi>
    Colin Watson (kamion) <http://launchpad.dev/~kamion>
    Foo Bar (name16) <http://launchpad.dev/~name16>
    Jeff Waugh (jdub) <http://launchpad.dev/~jdub>
    Mark Shuttleworth (mark) <http://launchpad.dev/~mark>
    <BLANKLINE>
    If the membership does expire, we'll send you one more message to let
    you know it's happened.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Thanks for using Launchpad!
    <BLANKLINE>
    ----------------------------------------

If the team's renewal policy is ONDEMAND, though, the member is invited
to renew his own membership.

    >>> ubuntu_team.renewal_policy = TeamMembershipRenewalPolicy.ONDEMAND
    >>> ubuntu_team.defaultrenewalperiod = 365
    >>> kamion_on_ubuntu_team = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(

If the team's renewal policy is NONE but the member has the necessary
rights to change the expiration date of his own membership (i.e. by
being the team's owner), the notification he gets will contain a link to
his memberhip page, where he can extend it.

Memberships renewed by the members themselves
---------------------------------------------

Another possible renewal policy for teams is ONDEMAND, which means that
team members are invited to renew their membership once it gets close to
their expiration date. When a member renew his own membership, a
notification is sent to all team admins.

    >>> karl = personset.getByName('karl')
    >>> mirror_admins = personset.getByName('ubuntu-mirror-admins')

Some special cases
------------------

When creating a new team, the owner has his membership's status changed
from approved to admin, but he won't get a notification of that.

    >>> team = personset.newTeam(mark, 'testteam', 'Test')
    >>> run_mail_jobs()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    0

    # Other tests expect an empty stub.test_emails, but if this one above
    # fails, I don't want a non-empty stub.test_emails to cause the tests
    # below to fail too.

    >>> stub.test_emails = []

If cprov is made an administrator of ubuntu_team, he'll only get one
email notification.

    >>> cprov = personset.getByName('cprov')
    >>> cprov_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     cprov, ubuntu_team)
    >>> login('mark@example.com')
    >>> setStatus(
    ...     cprov_membership, TeamMembershipStatus.ADMIN, reviewer=mark)
    >>> run_mail_jobs()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    6

    >>> print_distinct_emails()
    From: Ubuntu Team <noreply@launchpad.net>
    To: colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com, foo.bar@canonical.com,
        jeff.waugh@ubuntulinux.com, limi@plone.org, mark@example.com
    Subject: cprov made admin by mark
    <BLANKLINE>
    The membership status of Celso Providelo (cprov) in the team Ubuntu Team
    (ubuntu-team) was changed by Mark Shuttleworth (mark) from Approved to
    Administrator.
    <http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team>
    ----------------------------------------
    From: Ubuntu Team <noreply@launchpad.net>
    To: celso.providelo@canonical.com
    Subject: cprov made admin by mark
    <BLANKLINE>
    The status of your membership in the team Ubuntu Team (ubuntu-team) was
    changed by Mark Shuttleworth (mark) from Approved to Administrator.
    <http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team>
    ----------------------------------------

If a team admin changes his own membership, the notification sent will
clearly say that the change was performed by the user himself, and it
will only be sent to the team administrators.

    >>> jdub = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('jdub')
    >>> jdub_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(jdub, ubuntu_team)
    >>> setStatus(jdub_membership, TeamMembershipStatus.APPROVED,
    ...           reviewer=jdub)
    >>> run_mail_jobs()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    5

    >>> print_distinct_emails()
    From: Ubuntu Team <noreply@launchpad.net>
    To: celso.providelo@canonical.com, colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com,
        foo.bar@canonical.com, limi@plone.org, mark@example.com
    Subject: Membership change: jdub in ubuntu-team
    <BLANKLINE>
    The membership status of Jeff Waugh (jdub) in the team Ubuntu Team
    (ubuntu-team) was changed by the user from Administrator to
    Approved.
    <http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team>
    ----------------------------------------

Deactivating the membership of a team also generates notifications for
the team which had the membership deactivated and to the administrators
of the hosting team. Note that the notification sent to the team whose
membership was deactivated will not talk about "your membership" as it
wouldn't make sense to the members of the team reading it.

    >>> mirror_admins_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     mirror_admins, ubuntu_team)
    >>> setStatus(mirror_admins_membership, TeamMembershipStatus.DEACTIVATED,
    ...           reviewer=mark, silent=False)
    >>> run_mail_jobs()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    6

    >>> print_distinct_emails()
    From: Ubuntu Team <noreply@launchpad.net>
    To: celso.providelo@canonical.com, colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com,
        foo.bar@canonical.com, karl@canonical.com, limi@plone.org,
        mark@example.com
    Subject: ubuntu-mirror-admins deactivated by mark
    <BLANKLINE>
    The membership status of Mirror Administrators (ubuntu-mirror-admins) in
    the team Ubuntu Team (ubuntu-team) was changed by Mark Shuttleworth
    (mark) from Approved to Deactivated.
    <http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team>
    ----------------------------------------

Deactivating memberships can also be done silently (no email
notifications sent) by Launchpad Administrators.

    >>> dumper = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('dumper')
    >>> hwdb_admins = personset.getByName('hwdb-team')
    >>> dumper_hwdb_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(dumper,
    ...     hwdb_admins)
    >>> print dumper_hwdb_membership.status.title
    Approved

    >>> ignored = login_person(admin_person)
    >>> setStatus(dumper_hwdb_membership, TeamMembershipStatus.DEACTIVATED,
    ...     reviewer=admin_person, silent=True)
    >>> run_mail_jobs()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    0

    >>> print dumper_hwdb_membership.status.title
    Deactivated

People who are not Launchpad Administrators, may not change other's
membership statues silently.

    >>> kamion = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('kamion')
    >>> stevea = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('stevea')
    >>> ignored = login_person(kamion)
    >>> ubuntu_team = personset.getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> kamion_ubuntu_team_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     kamion, ubuntu_team)
    >>> stevea_ubuntu_team_membership = membershipset.getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     stevea, ubuntu_team)
    >>> print kamion_ubuntu_team_membership.status.title
    Administrator

    >>> print stevea_ubuntu_team_membership.status.title
    Approved

    >>> setStatus(stevea_ubuntu_team_membership,
    ...     TeamMembershipStatus.DEACTIVATED, reviewer=kamion, silent=True)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    UserCannotChangeMembershipSilently: ...

    >>> print stevea_ubuntu_team_membership.status.title

When a user joins a team with a mailing list, the new member's
notification email contain subscription information.

    >>> owner = factory.makePerson(name='team-owner')
    >>> ignored = login_person(owner)
    >>> team_one, list_one = factory.makeTeamAndMailingList(
