ProductSeries series page
=========================

    # There are no obsolete series in the data, create one.
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.product import IProductSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.series import SeriesStatus

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> productset = getUtility(IProductSet)
    >>> firefox = productset.getByName('firefox')
    >>> series = factory.makeProductSeries(
    ...     name='xxx', product=firefox, summary='Use true GTK UI.')
    >>> series.status = SeriesStatus.OBSOLETE
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> logout()

Each project has a page that lists the status of all its series.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('View full history').click()
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    timeline...

Each series, the status, milestones, releases, bugs and blueprints are
listed.

    >>> content = find_main_content(anon_browser.contents)
    >>> series_trunk = find_tag_by_id(content, 'series-trunk')
    >>> print extract_text(series_trunk)

    >>> print series_1_0['class']
    series

Any user can see that obsolete series are lowlight. Obsolete series do not
show bug status counts because it is expensive to retrieve the information.

    >>> series_xxx = find_tag_by_id(content, 'series-xxx')
    >>> print extract_text(series_xxx)
    xxx series Obsolete
    Blueprints targeted: None
    Use true GTK UI.

    >>> print series_xxx['class']
    lowlight series
