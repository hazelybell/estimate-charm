    <h1>Sharing kinds of information</h1>

    <p>
        Launchpad has three kinds of restricted information &mdash;
        proprietary, embargoed and user-data. You'll only see them if they're
        shared with you.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are also three ways to share &mdash; share all, share some or
        share none.
    </p>

    <h3>Share some</h3>

    <p>
        If you are a project maintainer, you may need to share a single bug or
        branch with a user or team to address an issue. You can share
        proprietary, private security, or private bugs and branches by
        subscribing users and teams to the bug or branch. You can then view
        the exceptional bugs and branches that you've shared.
    </p>


    <h2>Kinds of information</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Proprietary</dt>
        <dd>
            Information owned by an organisation, held in confidence. Visible
            to people affiliated with the project and its organisation.
        </dd>

        <dt>Private Security</dt>
        <dd>
            Visible if you're involved in fixing and deploying critical
            vulnerability and exploits
            (<a class="sprite external-link"
                href="http://cve.mitre.org/">CVEs</a>). Embargo will be lifted
            after the fixes have been made, so that the information is visible
            to anyone who may need to ensure that their version is secure.
        </dd>

        <dt>User-data</dt>
        <dd>
            Information containing personal data. Visible if you're working
            with, or able to remove, the personal data from the information.
            It can only be made public after the personal data is removed.
        </dd>
    </dl>

            information is shared.
        </dd>

        <dt>Some</dt>
        <dd>
            Some proprietary, private security, or private project
            information is shared via a bug or branch subscription.
        </dd>

        <dt>Nothing</dt>
