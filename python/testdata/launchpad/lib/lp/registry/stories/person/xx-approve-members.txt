= Reviewing proposed members =

We have one page in which a team admin can review (approve/decline/hold) all
proposed members at once.

    >>> browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic mark@example.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team/+members')
    >>> browser.getLink('Approve or decline members').click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team/+editproposedmembers'

Let's have a look at the proposed members that we have.

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'member-list'))
    Andrew Bennetts (Applied on ...)     Approve Decline Hold
    Sample Person (Applied on ...)       Approve Decline Hold

The team admin approves Andrew Bennetts' membership and declines Sample
Person's. A comment is also sent to the applying users and the team admins.

    >>> from lp.services.mail import stub
    >>> browser.getControl(name='action_12').value = ['decline']
    >>> browser.getControl(name='action_7').value = ['approve']
    >>> browser.getControl(name='comment').value = 'Thanks for your interest'
    >>> browser.getControl('Save changes').click()
    >>> from lp.testing.mail_helpers import run_mail_jobs
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> run_mail_jobs()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    12
    >>> for from_addr, to_addrs, raw_msg in sorted(stub.test_emails):
    ...     print to_addrs
    ['andrew.bennetts@ubuntulinux.com']
    ['colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com']
    ['colin.watson@ubuntulinux.com']
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com']
    ['foo.bar@canonical.com']
    ['jeff.waugh@ubuntulinux.com']
    ['jeff.waugh@ubuntulinux.com']
    ['limi@plone.org']
    ['limi@plone.org']
    ['mark@example.com']
    ['mark@example.com']
    ['test@canonical.com']
    >>> print raw_msg

     Thanks for your interest

As we can see, Andrew is now listed among the active members and Sample Person
as an inactive one.

    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/~ubuntu-team/+members'
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'activemembers'))
    Name Member since Expires Status
    ...
    Andrew Bennetts
    ...

    # Need to do this check manually because the declined members are not
    # listed anywhere.
    >>> from lp.registry.model.person import Person
    >>> from lp.registry.model.teammembership import TeamMembershipSet
    >>> membership = TeamMembershipSet().getByPersonAndTeam(
    ...     Person.byName('name12'), Person.byName('ubuntu-team'))
    >>> membership.status.title
    'Declined'

And now we see that there are no pending members left.

    >>> browser.getLink('Approve or decline members')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError
