= LoginToken pages =

Users interact with login tokens for operations that require the user to prove
he has access to a resource that is external to Launchpad. For example,
claiming an email address or a OpenPGP key require the user to use the login
token sent to him in an email.


== Validating GPG keys ==

In order to add a GPG key to Launchpad we require that the person
registering it decrypt an email and follow the instructions in it.
The last step in that workflow is the +validategpg page, which can
be accessed by non-logged-in users. That page will attempt to access
all email addresses of the requester but that may fail when the user
is not logged in and the requester has chosen to hide his email
addresses, so here we'll make sure that even non-logged-in users can
perform the last step of the workflow for adding a GPG key.
