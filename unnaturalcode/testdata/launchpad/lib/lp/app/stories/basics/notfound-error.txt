404 pages
=========

If you follow a link from another page to a Launchpad page that doesn't
exist, the 404 page includes a link back to the referring page.

(We can't test the 404 page using testbrowser, because it won't show us
the contents of any error page. So we use http() instead.)

    >>> page_with_referer = str(http(r"""
    ... GET /+fhqwhgads HTTP/1.1
    ... Referer: http://launchpad.dev/+about
    ... """))
    >>> print page_with_referer
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    ...href="http://launchpad.dev/+about"...

It also contains instructions specific to broken links.

    >>> main_content = find_main_content(page_with_referer)
    >>> for paragraph in main_content('p'):
    ...     print extract_text(paragraph)
    This page does not exist, or you may not have permission to see it.
    If you have been to this page before, it is possible it has been removed.
    If you got here from a link elsewhere on Launchpad...
    Otherwise, complain to the maintainers of the page that linked here.
    If this is blocking your work...

If you go to a non-existent page directly, without sending a Referer:
header, the 404 page does not try to link to the referring page.
And the advice about broken links is gone, replaced with advice about
mistyped URLs.

XXX 20080114 mpt: At the time of writing, this test passed if
'"HTTP_REFERER": self.host_and_port,' was commented out of
sourcecode/zope/src/zope/app/testing/functional.py. The test is
disabled until bug 98437 is fixed.

    # >>> page_with_no_referer = str(http(r"""

    # Check that you entered the address correctly.
