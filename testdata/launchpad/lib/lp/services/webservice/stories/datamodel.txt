End-to-end data model tests
***************************

The lazr.restful tests use in-memory Python objects, and Launchpad
uses Storm backed by a database. This means it's nice to have some
end-to-end tests of code paths that, on the surface, look like they're
already tested in lazr.restful.

  >>> def get_collection(version="devel", start=0, size=2):
  ...     collection = webservice.get(
  ...         ("/people?ws.op=find&text=s&ws.start=%s&ws.size=%s" %
  ...          (start, size)),
  ...         api_version=version)
  ...     return collection.jsonBody()


Normally, the total size of a collection is not served along with the
collection; it's available by following the total_size_link.

  >>> collection = get_collection()
  >>> print sorted(collection.keys())
  [u'entries', u'next_collection_link', u'start', u'total_size_link']
  >>> print webservice.get(collection['total_size_link']).jsonBody()
  9

If an entire collection fits on one page (making the size of the
collection obvious), 'total_size' is served instead of
'total_size_link'.

  >>> collection = get_collection(size=100)
  >>> print sorted(collection.keys())
  [u'entries', u'start', u'total_size']
  >>> print collection['total_size']
  9

If the last page of the collection is fetched (making the total size
of the collection semi-obvious), 'total_size' is served instead of
'total_size_link'.

  >>> collection = get_collection(start=8)
  >>> print sorted(collection.keys())
  [u'entries', u'prev_collection_link', u'start', u'total_size']
  >>> print collection['total_size']
  9
