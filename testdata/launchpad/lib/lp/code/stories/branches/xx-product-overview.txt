== Latest branches ==

On the product overview page there is a portlet to show recently
registered branches.

    >>> def show_latest_branches(url):
    ...     """Show the latest branches portlet at `url`."""
    ...     browser.open(url)
    ...     branches = find_portlet(browser.contents, 'Latest branches')
    ...     if branches is None:
    ...         print "No 'Latest branches' portlet found at %s" % (url,)
    ...         return
    ...     for list_item in branches.fetch('li'):
    ...         print extract_text(list_item)

    >>> def make_branch_on_product(product, branch_name, person_name):
    ...     """Make a branch on `product`.
    ...
    ...     The name of the branch is `branch_name` and the display
    ...     name of the owner is `person_name`.
    ...     """
    ...     owner = factory.makePerson(displayname=person_name)
    ...     factory.makeProductBranch(
    ...         product=product, owner=owner, name=branch_name)

First we make a product that has three branches registered on it.

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> product = factory.makeProduct()
    >>> make_branch_on_product(product, 'apple', 'Joe Bloggs')
    >>> make_branch_on_product(product, 'bear', 'Jane Doe')
    >>> make_branch_on_product(product, 'cabbage', 'Neil Armstrong')
    >>> logout()
