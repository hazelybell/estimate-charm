NascentUpload Announcements
===========================

NascentUpload announces uploads according its final status (NEW,
AUTO-APPROVED, UNAPPROVED) and its destination pocket:

 * NEW to RELEASE/PROPOSED (via insecure): submitter set (changes signer,
   Changed-by and maintainer) receives an 'new' warning message.

 * UNAPPROVED to frozen-RELEASE/UPDATES/BACKPORTS/PROPOSED (via insecure):
   submitter set receives an 'unapproved' warning (announcement is
   sent after the upload gets reviewed by archive-admin at queue time).

 * AUTO-APPROVED to RELEASE/PROPOSED (via insecure): submitter set receives
   an 'acceptance' warning and the target distroseries changeslist address
   receives an 'announcement' message.

 * AUTO-APPROVED to BACKPORTS (via sync): submitter set receives an
   'acceptance' warning ('announcement' is skipped).

 * NEW, AUTO-APPROVED or UNAPPROVED source uploads targeted to section
   'translations' (all policies, all pockets) do not generate any
   messages. Remembering that NEW and UNAPPROVED messages are also
   suppressed in 'queue' application.

It's important to notice that all types of upload-notification
contains the special header 'X-Katie', its presence is checked by
third part application and also in our changeslist (gutsy-changes@).
See further information in bug #121752.

PPA upload notifications also include a 'X-Launchpad-PPA' email header
containing the target PPA owner name, see bug #172377.

We need to be logged into the security model in order to get any further

    >>> from lp.testing.dbuser import switch_dbuser
    >>> switch_dbuser('launchpad')
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

Helper functions to examine emails that were sent:

    >>> from lp.services.mail import stub
    >>> from lp.testing.mail_helpers import pop_notifications

    >>> def by_to_addrs(a, b):
    ...     return cmp(a[1], b[1])

    >>> def print_addrlist(field):
    ...    for entry in sorted([addr.strip() for addr in field.split(',')]):
    ...        print entry

Import the test keys to use 'insecure' policy.

    >>> from lp.testing.gpgkeys import import_public_test_keys
    >>> import_public_test_keys()

For the purpose of this test, hoary needs to be an open (development)
distroseries so that we can upload to it. Also adjust 'changeslist'
address and allow uploads to universe:

    >>> from lp.services.librarian.interfaces import (
    ...     ILibraryFileAliasSet,
    ...     )
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.series import SeriesStatus
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> hoary = ubuntu['hoary']
    >>> hoary.status = SeriesStatus.DEVELOPMENT
    >>> hoary.changeslist = "hoary-announce@lists.ubuntu.com"
    >>> fake_chroot = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[1]
    >>> trash = hoary['hppa'].addOrUpdateChroot(fake_chroot)

NEW source upload to RELEASE pocket via 'sync' policy (it presents
the same behaviour than using insecure policy, apart from allowing
unsigned changes):

    >>> from lp.archiveuploader.nascentupload import NascentUpload
    >>> from lp.archiveuploader.tests import datadir, getPolicy

    >>> sync_policy = getPolicy(
    ...     name='sync', distro='ubuntu', distroseries='hoary')

    >>> from lp.services.log.logger import DevNullLogger
    >>> bar_src = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('suite/bar_1.0-1/bar_1.0-1_source.changes'),
    ...     sync_policy, DevNullLogger())
    >>> bar_src.process()

    >>> from lp.services.log.logger import FakeLogger
    >>> bar_src.logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> result = bar_src.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    ...
    DEBUG Sent a mail:
    ...
    DEBUG NEW: bar_1.0.orig.tar.gz
    DEBUG NEW: bar_1.0-1.diff.gz
    DEBUG NEW: bar_1.0-1.dsc
    ...
    DEBUG above if files already exist in other distroseries.
    ...
    DEBUG --
    DEBUG You are receiving this email because you are the uploader,
    maintainer or
    DEBUG signer of the above package.

There is only one email generated:

    >>> [notification] = pop_notifications()

    >>> notification['X-Katie']
    'Launchpad actually'

    >>> notification['Subject']
    '[ubuntu/hoary] bar 1.0-1 (New)'

    >>> print_addrlist(notification['To'])
    Daniel Silverstone <daniel.silverstone@canonical.com>

Let's ACCEPT bar sources in order to make the next uploads of this
series *known* in hoary:

    >>> bar_src.queue_root.setAccepted()
    >>> pub_records = bar_src.queue_root.realiseUpload()

Make the uploaded orig file available to librarian lookups

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()


Uploading the same package again will result in a rejection email:

    >>> bar_src = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('suite/bar_1.0-1/bar_1.0-1_source.changes'),
    ...     sync_policy, DevNullLogger())
    >>> bar_src.process()

    >>> bar_src.logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> result = bar_src.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    DEBUG bar diff from 1.0-1 to 1.0-1 requested
    DEBUG Setting it to ACCEPTED
    ...

    DEBUG Rejected:
    DEBUG The source bar - 1.0-1 is already accepted in ubuntu/hoary
           and you cannot upload the same version within the same
           distribution. You have to modify the source version and
           re-upload.
    ...

    >>> [notification] = pop_notifications()

    >>> notification['X-Katie']
    'Launchpad actually'

    >>> print_addrlist(notification['To'])
    Daniel Silverstone <daniel.silverstone@canonical.com>

Upload notifications from primary archive do not contain the
'X-Launchpad-PPA' header, since it doesn't apply to this context.

    >>> 'X-Launchpad-PPA' in notification.keys()
    False

Notifications for source uploads will contain the 'X-Launchpad-Component'
header however.

    >>> 'X-Launchpad-Component' in notification.keys()
    True

    >>> notification['X-Launchpad-Component']
    'component=universe, section=devel'

This is the body of the rejection email.

    >>> notification['X-Katie']
    'Launchpad actually'

    >>> print_addrlist(notification['To'])
    Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>

On PPA upload notifications the 'X-Launchpad-PPA' is present and
contains the target PPA owner account name.

    >>> notification['X-Launchpad-PPA']
    'name16'

However, PPA upload notifications do not contain an attachment with the
original changesfile.

    >>> attachment = notification.get_payload()[1]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    IndexError: list index out of range

See further tests upon PPA upload notifications on
archiveuploader/tests/test_ppauploadprocessor.

NEW binary upload to RELEASE pocket via 'sync' policy (we need to
override sync policy to allow binary uploads):

    >>> from lp.archiveuploader.uploadpolicy import ArchiveUploadType
    >>> modified_sync_policy = getPolicy(
    ...     name='sync', distro='ubuntu', distroseries='hoary')
    >>> modified_sync_policy.accepted_type = ArchiveUploadType.BINARY_ONLY

    >>> bar_src = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('suite/bar_1.0-1_binary/bar_1.0-1_i386.changes'),
    ...     modified_sync_policy, DevNullLogger())
    >>> bar_src.process()

    >>> bar_src.logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> result = bar_src.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    DEBUG Not sending email; upload is from a build.

We simply ignore messages generated at this step because they are not
going to exist in production. We simply need this binary to be published
in order to test other features in post-release pockets.

    >>> ignore = pop_notifications()

Let's accept & publish bar binary in order to make the next uploads of
this series *known* in hoary:

    >>> bar_src.queue_root.setAccepted()
    >>> pub_records = bar_src.queue_root.realiseUpload()


NEW source uploads for 'translations' section via sync policy:

    >>> modified_sync_policy = getPolicy(
    ...     name='sync', distro='ubuntu', distroseries='hoary')

    >>> lang_pack = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('language-packs/language-pack-pt_1.0-1_source.changes'),
    ...     modified_sync_policy, DevNullLogger())
    >>> lang_pack.process()

    >>> lang_pack.logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> result = lang_pack.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    DEBUG Skipping acceptance and announcement, it is a language-package
    upload.

    >>> lang_pack.queue_root.status.name
    'NEW'

No messages were generated since this upload is targeted for the
'translation' section:

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    0

Accept and publish this series:

    >>> lang_pack.queue_root.setAccepted()
    >>> pub_records = lang_pack.queue_root.realiseUpload()


AUTO_APPROVED source uploads for 'translations' section:

    >>> modified_sync_policy = getPolicy(
    ...     name='sync', distro='ubuntu', distroseries='hoary')

    >>> lang_pack = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('language-packs/language-pack-pt_1.0-2_source.changes'),

Again, no messages were generated since this upload is targeted for
'translation' section:

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    0

Release hoary, enable uploads to post-release pockets:

    >>> hoary.status = SeriesStatus.CURRENT

UNAPPROVED source uploads for 'translations' section via insecure:

    >>> insecure_policy = getPolicy(name='insecure', distro='ubuntu')
    >>> insecure_policy.setDistroSeriesAndPocket('hoary-updates')

    >>> lang_pack = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('language-packs/language-pack-pt_1.0-3_source.changes'),
    ...     insecure_policy, DevNullLogger())

    >>> lang_pack.logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> result = lang_pack.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    DEBUG language-pack-pt diff from 1.0-2 to 1.0-3 requested
    DEBUG Setting it to UNAPPROVED
    DEBUG Skipping acceptance and announcement, it is a language-package
    upload.

    >>> lang_pack.queue_root.status.name
    'UNAPPROVED'

UNAPPROVED message was also skipped for an upload targeted to
'translation' section:

    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> len(stub.test_emails)
    0


An UNAPPROVED binary upload via insecure will send one email saying that
the upload is waiting for approval:

    >>> bar_src = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('suite/bar_1.0-2/bar_1.0-2_source.changes'),
    ...     insecure_policy, DevNullLogger())

    'Launchpad actually'

    >>> print_addrlist(notification['To'])
    Daniel Silverstone <daniel.silverstone@canonical.com>
    Foo Bar <foo.bar@canonical.com>

    >>> notification['Subject']
    '[ubuntu/hoary-updates] bar 1.0-2 (Waiting for approval)'

And clean up.

    >>> import os
    >>> upload_data = datadir('suite/bar_1.0-2')
    >>> os.remove(os.path.join(upload_data, 'bar_1.0.orig.tar.gz'))

UNAPPROVED upload to BACKPORTS via insecure policy will send a notification
saying they are waiting for approval:

    >>> unapproved_backports_policy = getPolicy(
    ...     name='insecure', distro='ubuntu', distroseries=None)
    >>> unapproved_backports_policy.setDistroSeriesAndPocket(
    ...     'hoary-backports')
    >>> bar_src = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(

DEBIAN SYNC upload of a source via the 'sync' policy.
These uploads do not generate any announcement emails for auto-accepted
packages, just the upload notification.

Make hoary developmental again, as syncs only happen at that stage of a
distroseries.

    >>> hoary.status = SeriesStatus.DEVELOPMENT

    >>> bar_src = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir(
    ...          'suite/bar_1.0-5_debian_auto_sync/bar_1.0-5_source.changes'),
    ...     sync_policy, DevNullLogger())
    >>> bar_src.process()

    >>> bar_src.logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> result = bar_src.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    ...

One email generated:

    >>> [notification] = pop_notifications()
    >>> notification['Subject']
    '[ubuntu/hoary] bar 1.0-5 (Accepted)'


In contrast, manual sync uploads do generate the announcement:

    >>> bar_src = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir(
    ...          'suite/bar_1.0-6/bar_1.0-6_source.changes'),
    ...     sync_policy, DevNullLogger())
    >>> bar_src.process()

    >>> bar_src.logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> result = bar_src.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    ...

Two emails generated:

    >>> import operator
    >>> msgs = pop_notifications(sort_key=operator.itemgetter('To'))
    >>> len(msgs)
    2

    >>> [message['To'] for message in msgs]
    ['Celso Providelo <celso.providelo@canonical.com>',
        'hoary-announce@lists.ubuntu.com']

    >>> [message['Subject'] for message in msgs]
    ['[ubuntu/hoary] bar 1.0-6 (Accepted)',
     '[ubuntu/hoary] bar 1.0-6 (Accepted)']

Reset hoary back to released and remove disk files created during processing:

    >>> hoary.status = SeriesStatus.CURRENT
    >>> os.remove(os.path.join(datadir('suite/bar_1.0-5_debian_auto_sync'),
    ...     'bar_1.0.orig.tar.gz'))
    >>> os.remove(os.path.join(datadir('suite/bar_1.0-6'),
    ...     'bar_1.0.orig.tar.gz'))

Dry run uploads should not generate any emails.  Call do_accept with
notify=False:

    >>> sync_policy = getPolicy(
    ...     name='sync', distro='ubuntu', distroseries='hoary')

    >>> bar_src = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir('suite/bar_1.0-1/bar_1.0-1_source.changes'),
    ...     sync_policy, DevNullLogger())
    >>> bar_src.process()

    >>> bar_src.logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> result = bar_src.do_accept(notify=False)

No emails generated:

    >>> msgs = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(msgs)
    0

Rejections with notify=False will also not generate any emails.

    >>> result = bar_src.do_reject(notify=False)
    >>> msgs = pop_notifications()
    >>> len(msgs)
    0

The PackageUpload record created by NascentUpload will be in the NEW
state if the package was not previously uploaded.  When accepted by an
archive admin using the queue tool, the queue tool will call
PackageUpload.notify() directly.  One of the arguments it can specify is
dry_run, which when True will not send any emails.  It will also log at
the INFO level what it /would/ have sent.

    >>> random_package_upload = hoary.getPackageUploads()[0]

permitted, but converted to ASCII, which is a limitation of the mailer.
However, UTF-8 in the mail content is preserved.

    >>> hoary.status = SeriesStatus.DEVELOPMENT
    >>> anything_policy = getPolicy(
    ...     name='anything', distro='ubuntu', distroseries='hoary')
    >>> bar_upload = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     datadir(
    ...         'suite/bar_1.0-10_utf8_changesfile/'
    ...         'bar_1.0-10_source.changes'),
    ...     anything_policy, DevNullLogger())
    >>> bar_upload.process()

    >>> bar_upload.logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> result = bar_upload.do_accept()
    DEBUG Creating queue entry
    ...

    >>> msgs = pop_notifications(sort_key=operator.itemgetter('To'))
    >>> len(msgs)
    2

"Cihar" should actually be "Čihař" but the mailer will convert to ASCII.

    >>> [message['From'] for message in msgs]
    ['Root <root@localhost>', 'Non-ascii changed-by Cihar
    <daniel.silverstone@canonical.com>']

UTF-8 text in the changes file that is sent on the email is preserved
in the MIME encoding. Please note also that the person that signed the
changes file is mentioned toward the end of the email.

    >>> announcement_email = msgs[0]
    >>> announcement_email.is_multipart()
    True

In order to facilitate scripts that parse announcement emails, the changes
file is enclosed as an attachment.

    >>> attachment = announcement_email.get_payload()[1]

Here's the attachment metadata.

    >>> attachment['Content-Disposition']
    'attachment; filename="changesfile"'

And what follows is the content of the attachment.

The attempt to upload a package with a malformed changes file name will
result in a rejection email.

We first create a misnamed copy of the changes file.

    >>> import shutil
    >>> originalp = datadir('suite/bar_1.0-1/bar_1.0-1_source.changes')
    >>> copyp = datadir('suite/bar_1.0-1/z-z_0.4.12-2~ppa2.changes')
    >>> shutil.copyfile(originalp, copyp)

And then try to upload using the changes file with the malformed name.

    >>> bar_src = NascentUpload.from_changesfile_path(
    ...     copyp, sync_policy, DevNullLogger())
    >>> bar_src.process()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    EarlyReturnUploadError: An error occurred that prevented further
    processing.

    >>> bar_src.logger = FakeLogger()
    >>> result = bar_src.do_accept()
    DEBUG Building recipients list.
    ...
    DEBUG Sending rejection email.
    DEBUG Sent a mail:

    >>> notification['X-Katie']

    >>> print_addrlist(notification['To'])

Remove the misnamed changes file copy used for testing.

    >>> os.unlink(copyp)
