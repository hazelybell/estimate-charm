          To merge two Launchpad accounts:
        </p>
        <ul class="bulleted">
          <li>You must be logged in to Launchpad under the account you
            want to keep.</li>
          <li>You must have access to the e-mail address registered
            under the other account that you want to remove.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You will receive an email notification requesting you authorize
          the merge, and once you've proven that you own the duplicated
          account's e-mail address, it will be assigned to you, along with
          everything else owned by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: If you no longer have access to the duplicated account's
          email address, you may place a
          <a href="/launchpad/+addquestion">support request</a>.
          The Launchpad administrators will tend to your request as soon
          as possible.
