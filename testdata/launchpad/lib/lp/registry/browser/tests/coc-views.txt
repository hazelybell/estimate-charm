key registered, directions are shown.

    ...     ol = content.find('ol')
    ...     if ol is not None:
    ...         for index, li in enumerate(ol.findAll('li')):
    ...             print '%s. %s' % ((index+1), extract_text(li))
    >>> user = factory.makePerson()
    >>> ignored = login_person(user)
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.codeofconduct import ICodeOfConductSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from lp.testing.pages import (
    ...     extract_text, find_tag_by_id)
    >>> coc_set = getUtility(ICodeOfConductSet)
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(coc_set, '+index', principal=user)
    >>> print_coc_directions(find_tag_by_id(view.render(), 'maincontent'))
