= Deleting product releases =

The main page of a product series includes a list of releases of that series.
The 0.9.2 milestone has a release.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/trunk')
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Series trunk : Mozilla Firefox

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(
    ...     user_browser.contents, 'series-trunk'))

A User with launchpad.Edit rights for a release can see the delete link and
access the delete page. A user without the necessary rights won't see the
link and cannot access the +delete page.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('0.9.2').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
