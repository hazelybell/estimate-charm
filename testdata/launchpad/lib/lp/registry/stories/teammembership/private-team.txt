== Viewing private teams ==

If a team's visibility attribute is set to Private, Launchpad
admins and members of that team can see the team.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import (
    ...     IPersonSet, PersonVisibility)
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> owner = factory.makePerson(name='team-owner')
    >>> priv_team = factory.makeTeam(name='private-team',
    ...     displayname='Private Team',owner=owner,
    ...     visibility=PersonVisibility.PRIVATE)
    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> cprov = person_set.getByName('cprov')
    >>> ignored = login_person(owner)
    >>> ignored = priv_team.addMember(cprov, reviewer=owner)
    >>> logout()

    >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~private-team')
    >>> admin_browser.title
    'Private Team in Launchpad'

    >>> cprov_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth='Basic celso.providelo@canonical.com:test')
    >>> cprov_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~private-team')
    >>> cprov_browser.title
    'Private Team in Launchpad'

The page indicates that the team is private.

    >>> privacy_info = find_tag_by_id(cprov_browser.contents, 'privacy')
    >>> print extract_text(privacy_info)
    Private team

A normal user cannot see the team.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~private-team')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotFound: ...

An anonymous user cannot see the team.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~private-team')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NotFound: ...


== Operations on a private team ==

The team can take on a restricted set of roles, such as being
subscribed to a bug, etc.

A regular user cannot subscribe a private team to a bug.
They get an error indicating the team is NotFound.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/bugs/13')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Subscribe someone else').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl(name='field.person').value = 'private-team'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Subscribe user').click()
    >>> print_feedback_messages(user_browser.contents)
    There is 1 error.
    Invalid value

A member of the team or an admin can subscribe a private team to a bug.

    >>> cprov_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/bugs/15')
    >>> cprov_browser.getLink('Subscribe someone else').click()
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(name='field.person').value = 'private-team'
    >>> cprov_browser.getControl('Subscribe user').click()
    >>> print_feedback_messages(cprov_browser.contents)
    Private Team team has been subscribed to this bug.

The private team has been subscribed to a bug and although a regular user is
allowed to know of the team's existence, they cannot subscribe that team to
another bug.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/bugs/5')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Subscribe someone else').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl(name='field.person').value = 'private-team'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Subscribe user').click()
    >>> print_feedback_messages(user_browser.contents)
    There is 1 error.
