Gina
====

A script that generates Launchpad database entries for tables related to
packages; bases itself on Katie data and Debian package/release tag files.

Steps to run this:

    1. createdb launchpad
    2. cd launchpad/database/schema ; make
    3. createdb katie 
    4. mail james@nocrew.org -s "give me a katie dump"
    5. psql katie < katie_dump
    6. mkdir keyrings
    7. rsync keyring.debian.org::keyrings/keyrings/* keyrings
    8. cp /srv/keyring/.no-name-yet.com/keyrings/*.gpg keyrings
    9. python grabber.py
    10. Use the next 4 hours to work on some other code

Using the Gina output:

    The current version of Soyuz supports all data collected by Gina:
    
    1. dropdb launchpad_dev
    2. createdb launchpad_dev
    3. psql -f fresh_large_dump launchpad_test
        
    -> Tons of packages (13k binaries and 7k sources)*
    -> Person-related information (name, multiple mails, gpgkey, etc)
    
    * the current implementation of Soyuz/SQLObject is quite slow to 
      fetch all information from DB, so don't forget to use "renice" 
      to reduce the postgres and the zope priority if your machine is
      `normal' (non-dual-Xeon), otherwise it will CRASH (I'm serious).
      It should become better with PSQL VIEWS and Batched Pages.

TODO:
    - Process OpenPGP keys properly
    - Loop over components, releases, distros
