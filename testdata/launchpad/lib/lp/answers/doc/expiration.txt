Questions Expiration
====================

It is not productive to have questions lying around forever in
the Answer Tracker. That's why we have a script which runs daily to
expire old questions on which there was no activity for the past two
weeks.

The expiration period is set using the
config.answertracker.days_before_expiration configuration variable. It
defaults to 15 days.

    >>> from lp.services.config import config
    >>> config.answertracker.days_before_expiration
    15

Only questions in the OPEN or NEEDSINFO state which aren't assigned to
somebody are subject to expiration.

    # Sanity check in case somebody modifies the question sampledata and
    # forget to update this script.
    >>> from lp.answers.enums import QuestionStatus
    >>> from lp.answers.model.question import Question
    >>> Question.select('status IN (%i,%i)' % (
    ...     QuestionStatus.OPEN.value,
    ...     QuestionStatus.NEEDSINFO.value)).count()
    9

    # By default, all open and needs info question should expire. Make
    # sure that no new questions were recently added and will make this
    # test fails in the future.
    >>> Question.select(
    ...     "datelastresponse >= current_timestamp - interval '15 days' OR "
    ...    "datelastquery >= current_timestamp - interval '15 days'").count()
    0

    # We need to massage sample data a little. Since all expiration
    # candidates in sample data would expire, do a little activity on
    # some of these.
    >>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    >>> from pytz import UTC
    >>> now = datetime.now(UTC)
    >>> two_weeks_ago = now - timedelta(days=14)
    >>> a_month_ago = now - timedelta(days=31)

    True

    # Link it to a FAQ item for the same reason. We are setting the
    # attribute directly, because using the linkFAQ API would update
    # the last updates date of the question and remove it from the expiration
    # set.
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> faq = old_open_question.target.newFAQ(
    ...     salgado, 'Why everyone think this is weird.',
    ...     "That's an easy one. It's because it is!")
    >>> removeSecurityProxy(old_open_question).faq = faq

    # A question linked to an non-Invalid bug is not expirable.
    >>> from lp.bugs.interfaces.bug import IBugSet

    INFO    Creating lockfile: /var/lock/launchpad-expire-questions.lock
    INFO    Expiring OPEN and NEEDSINFO questions without activity for the

The status of the OPEN and NEEDSINFO questions that had recent activity
wasn't modified by the script:

    >>> print recent_open_question.status.title
    Open
    >>> print recent_needsinfo_question.status.title
    Needs information

Neither the old one which was assigned to Foo Bar:

    >>> print old_assigned_open_question.status.title
    Open

The old question with non-Invalid bug link is still Open status:

    >>> print bug_link_question.status.title
    Open

But the other ones status was changed to 'Expired':

    >>> print old_needs_info_question.status.title
    Expired
    >>> print old_open_question.status.title
    Expired
    >>> print invalid_bug_question.status.title
    Expired

The message explaining the reason for the expiration was posted by the
Launchpad Janitor celebrity:

    >>> expiration_message = old_needs_info_question.messages[-1]
    >>> print expiration_message.action.name
    EXPIRE
    >>> print expiration_message.new_status.title
    Expired
    >>> print expiration_message.owner.name
    janitor

    >>> print expiration_message.text_contents
    This question was expired because it remained in the
    'Needs information' state without activity for the last 15 days.
