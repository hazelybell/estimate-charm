    <h1>Translation groups</h1>

    <p>
      Launchpad makes it easy for anyone to make or suggest translations for
      your project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Translation groups are a convenient way to delegate responsibility for
      reviewing the translations that people suggest for your project.
    </p>

    <p>Each translation group is an umbrella organisations &mdash; made up of
      <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Teams" target="_blank">teams</a> and
      individuals &mdash; that have taken responsibility for a particular
      language.
    </p>

    <p>When you choose a translation group, you're entrusting the review of
       your project's translations to its members. Each group has its own
       policies for standard vocabulary, how to handle plural forms and so on.
    </p>

    <p>Unless your project is a member of an umbrella group that has its own
       translations group in Launchpad, or you have other specific needs, you
       should choose the <a
       href="https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/launchpad-translators"
       target="_blank">Launchpad Translators group</a>. (<a
       href="https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/LaunchpadTranslators"
       target="_blank">Read Launchpad Translators' policy &gt;</a>)
    </p>

    <p>To choose an alternative group, <a
       href="https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups" target="_blank">
       browse the list of translation groups</a> in Launchpad. If you are
       certain none of the existing groups is suitable, <a
       href="https://answers.launchpad.net/rosetta/+addquestion"
       target="_blank">contact the Launchpad team</a>.
