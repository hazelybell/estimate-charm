Any user can see a table describing the files that are associated with the
release. Each file is linked.

    >>> table = find_tag_by_id(content, 'downloads')
    >>> print extract_text(table)
    File                            Description  Downloads
    firefox_0.9.2.orig.tar.gz (md5)              -

    >>> print table.a
    <a title="firefox_0.9.2.orig.tar.gz (9.5 MiB)"
       href=".../firefox/trunk/0.9.2/+download/firefox_0.9.2.orig.tar.gz">...

There is an link about how to verify downloaded files.

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('How do I verify a download?')
    <Link ... url='http://launchpad.dev/+help-registry/verify-downloads.html'>

If the file had been downloaded, we'd see the number of times it was
downloaded and the date of the last download on that table as well.

    # Manually update the download counter for that file above so that we can
    # test it.
    >>> from datetime import date, datetime
    >>> from lp.services.librarian.model import LibraryFileAlias
    >>> lfa = LibraryFileAlias.selectOne(
    ...     LibraryFileAlias.q.filename == 'firefox_0.9.2.orig.tar.gz')
    >>> lfa.updateDownloadCount(date(2006, 5, 4), None, 1)

    >>> anon_browser.reload()
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'downloads'))
    File                            Description  Downloads
    firefox_0.9.2.orig.tar.gz (md5)              1 last downloaded ...
                              Total downloads:   1

When a file has been downloaded on the present day, all we can say is that
it's been downloaded "today".  That's because we don't have the time it was
downloaded, so we can't say it was downloaded a few minutes/hours ago.

    >>> import pytz
    >>> lfa.updateDownloadCount(datetime.now(pytz.utc).date(), None, 4356)
    >>> anon_browser.reload()
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(anon_browser.contents, 'downloads'))
    File                            Description  Downloads
    firefox_0.9.2.orig.tar.gz (md5)              4,357 last downloaded today
                              Total downloads:   4,357
