     Components and Sections
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Component refers to a group of packages within a DistroSeries that
are related by their need, shipment condition and/or licence.

Zope auxiliary test toolchain:

 >>> from zope.component import getUtility
 >>> from lp.testing import verifyObject

Importing Component content class and its interface:

 >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.component import IComponent
 >>> from lp.soyuz.model.component import Component

Get an Component instance from the current sampledata:

 >>> main = Component.get(1)

Test some attributes:

 >>> print main.id, main.name
 1 main

Check if the instance corresponds to the declared interface:

 >>> verifyObject(IComponent, main)
 True

Now perform the tests for the Component ContentSet class, ComponentSet.

Check if it can be imported:

 >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.component import IComponentSet

Check we can use the set as a utility:

 >>> component_set = getUtility(IComponentSet)

Test iteration over the sampledata default components:

 >>> for c in component_set:
 ...    print c.name
 main
 restricted
 universe
 multiverse
 partner

by default, they are ordered by 'id'.

Test __getitem__ method, retrieving a component by name:

 >>> print component_set['universe'].name
 universe

Test get method, retrieving a component by its id:

 >>> print component_set.get(2).name
 restricted

New component creation for a given name:

 >>> new_comp = component_set.new('test')
 >>> print new_comp.id, new_comp.name
 6 test

Ensuring a component (if not found, create it):

 >>> component_set.ensure('test').id
 6

 >>> component_set.ensure('test2').id
 7


Importing Section content class and its interface:

 >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.section import ISection
 >>> from lp.soyuz.model.section import Section

Get a Section instance from the current sampledata:

 >>> base = Section.get(1)

Test some attributes:

 >>> print base.id, base.name
 1 base

Check if the instance corresponds to the declared interface:

 >>> verifyObject(ISection, base)
 True

Now perform the tests for the Section ContentSet class, SectionSet.

Check if it can be imported:

 >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.section import ISectionSet

Check we can use the set as a utility:

 >>> section_set = getUtility(ISectionSet)

Test iteration over the sampledata default sections:

 >>> for s in section_set:
 ...    print s.name
 base
 web
 editors
 admin
 comm
 debian-installer
 devel
 doc
 games
 gnome
 graphics
 interpreters
 kde
 libdevel
 libs
 mail
 math
 misc
 net
 news
 oldlibs
 otherosfs
 perl
 python
 shells
 sound
 tex
 text
 translations
 utils
 x11
 electronics
 embedded
 hamradio
 science

by default they are ordered by 'id'.

Test __getitem__ method, retrieving a section by name:

 >>> print section_set['science'].name
 science

Test get method, retrieving a section by its id:

 >>> print section_set.get(2).name
 web

New section creation for a given name:

 >>> new_sec = section_set.new('test')
 >>> print new_sec.id, new_sec.name
 36 test

Ensuring a section (if not found, create it):

 >>> section_set.ensure('test').id
 36

 >>> section_set.ensure('test2').id
 37
