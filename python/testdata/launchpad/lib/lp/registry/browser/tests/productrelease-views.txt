ProductRelease pages
====================

Views that support the ProductRelease object.


Adding a product release
------------------------

A new ProductRelease can be created using ProductReleaseAddView.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> owner = factory.makePerson(name='app-owner')
    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(name='app', owner=owner)
    >>> series = factory.makeProductSeries(name='simple', product=product)
    >>> naked_milestone = removeSecurityProxy(series).newMilestone('0.1')
    >>> print naked_milestone.active
    True

The view explains what that the user is creating a release, and lists
the other releases for the series. There are no other releases yet.

    >>> ignored = login_person(owner)
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(naked_milestone, '+addrelease')
    >>> print view.label
    Create a new release for App
    >>> print view.page_title
    Create a new release for App

The view creates a checkbox to allow the user to keep the milestone
active, which is normally deactivated when a release is made.

    >>> print view.widgets['keep_milestone_active'].hint
    Only select this if bugs or blueprints still need to be targeted to this
    project release's milestone.

Submitting the form data creates the release and deactivates the
milestone.

    >>> form = {
    ...     'field.datereleased': '2007-05-11',
    ...     'field.release_notes': 'Initial release.',
    ...     'field.changelog': 'commits',
    ...     'field.actions.create': 'Create release',
    ...     'field.keep_milestone_active.used': '', # false
    ...     }
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(naked_milestone, '+addrelease', form=form)
    >>> print view.errors
    []

    >>> print view.widget_errors
    {}

    >>> print naked_milestone.active
    False

    >>> for release in series.releases:
    ...     print release.version, release.release_notes, release.datereleased
    0.1 Initial release. 2007-05-11 00:00:00+00:00

    >>> transaction.commit()

Only one release can be created for the milestone.

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(naked_milestone, '+addrelease', form=form)
    >>> for notice in view.request.response.notifications:
    ...     print notice.message
    A project release already exists for this milestone.

The milestone can be kept active when a release is created by submitting
the keep_milestone_active option as 'on' (the value of the checkbox).

    >>> active_milestone = series.newMilestone('0.2')
    >>> print active_milestone.active
    True

    >>> form = {
    ...     'field.datereleased': '2007-05-11',
    ...     'field.release_notes': 'Initial release.',
    ...     'field.changelog': 'commits',
    ...     'field.actions.create': 'Create release',
    ...     'field.keep_milestone_active': 'on',
    ...     }
    >>> view = create_initialized_view(
    ...     active_milestone, '+addrelease', form=form)
    >>> print view.errors
    []

    >>> print view.widget_errors
    {}

    >>> view.request.response.notifications
    []

    >>> print active_milestone.active
    True


Creating a release for a series
-------------------------------

It is possible to create a release directly from a series, the release's
milestone can be created via an AJAX command.

The view collects the required release fields, and adds fields to to
set the milestone.

    >>> view = create_initialized_view(series, '+addrelease', principal=owner)
    >>> view.field_names
    ['datereleased', 'release_notes', 'changelog']

    >>> [field.__name__ for field in view.form_fields]
    ['milestone_for_release', 'keep_milestone_active', 'datereleased',
     'release_notes', 'changelog']
    >>> print view.label
    Create a new release for App
    >>> print view.page_title
    Create a new release for App

The rendered template includes a script that adds a js-action link to
show a formoverlay that updates the milestone_for_release field.

    >>> from lp.testing.pages import find_tag_by_id

    >>> script = find_tag_by_id(view.render(), 'milestone-script')
    >>> print script
    <script id="milestone-script" type="text/javascript">
        LPJS.use(... 'lp.registry.milestoneoverlay'...
            var milestone_form_uri = '.../app/simple/+addmilestone/++form++';
            var series_uri = '/app/simple';
            ...
            Y.on('domready', function () {
                var select_menu = get_by_id('field.milestone_for_release');
                var create_milestone_link = Y.Node.create(
                    '&lt;a href="+addmilestone" id="create-milestone-link" ' +
                    'class="add js-action sprite"&gt;Create milestone&lt;/a&gt;'); ...
