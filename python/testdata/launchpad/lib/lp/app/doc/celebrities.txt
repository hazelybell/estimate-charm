Launchpad Celebrities
=====================

https://dev.launchpad.net/LaunchpadCelebrities

There are a number of special objects, some of which exist in the
database, which we want to give easy access to in the code. To this end,
there is an ILaunchpadCelebrities utility available that gives access to

    >>> print ubuntu_techboard.name
    techboard

    >>> celebs.ubuntu_techboard == ubuntu_techboard
    True


Person celebrities
------------------

Each person celebrity has a corresponding "in_" attribute in
IPersonRoles, to check if a person has that role. If the attributes
differ, IPersonRoles needs to be synced to ILaunchpadCelebrities by
adding/removing the appropriate "in_" attribute(s).

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.role import IPersonRoles
    >>> def get_person_celebrity_names():
    ...     for name in ILaunchpadCelebrities.names():
    ...         if IPerson.providedBy(getattr(celebs, name)):
    ...             yield "in_" + name
    >>> def get_person_roles_names():
    ...     for name in IPersonRoles.names():
    ...         if name.startswith("in_"):
    ...             yield name

Treating the lists as sets and determining their difference gives us a
clear picture of what is missing where.

    >>> person_celebrity_names = set(get_person_celebrity_names())
    >>> person_roles_names = set(get_person_roles_names())
    >>> print "Please add to IPersonRoles: " + (
    ...       ", ".join(list(person_celebrity_names - person_roles_names)))
    Please add to IPersonRoles:

    >>> print "Please remove from IPersonRoles: " + (
    ...       ", ".join(list(person_roles_names - person_celebrity_names)))
    Please remove from IPersonRoles:


Detecting if a person is a celebrity
------------------------------------

We can ask if a person has celebrity status.

    True

    >>> celebs.isCelebrityPerson(obsolete_junk.name)
    False

    >>> celebs.isCelebrityPerson('admins')
    True

    >>> celebs.isCelebrityPerson('admin')

    >>> celebs.isCelebrityPerson('janitor')
    True
