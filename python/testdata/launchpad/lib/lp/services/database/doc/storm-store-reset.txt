= Resetting stores at the end of requests =

Storm allows objects to be used across transaction boundaries, but that
doesn't play well with Launchpad because we already have plenty of code
out there that cache things in instance variables, so if we don't reset
the stores these caches may end up being carried from one request to
another.

However, we have many tests that want to use an object after we've
committed a transaction, so we decided not to reset MASTER stores when
running the test suite.

Since the web app is not run in the main thread (unlike the test suite)
we rely on that to find out whether or not to reset stores.
