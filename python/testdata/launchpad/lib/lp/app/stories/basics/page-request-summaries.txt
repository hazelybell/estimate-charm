Launchpad pages end with a comment that displays how many actions outside of
the regular python code we've issued to satisfy the request. Note that we say "at

finish rendering -- the authoritative source is in OOPS reports or in the web
app's stderr.

  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/')
  >>> print browser.contents
  <!DOCTYPE...
  ...<!--... At least ... actions issued in ... seconds ...-->...

It's available for any page:


  >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~mark/')
  >>> print browser.contents
