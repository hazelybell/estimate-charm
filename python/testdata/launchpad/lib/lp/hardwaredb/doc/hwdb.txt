== Storage of raw submissions for the hardware database ==

The hardware database clients submits an XML file with collected hardware
information and other data. This file is stored without any parsing in a
librarian file. A reference to this file is stored in the table HWSubmission,
together with the following data:


    >>> from lp.hardwaredb.interfaces.hwdb import IHWSubmissionSet
    >>> sample_submission = getUtility(IHWSubmissionSet).getBySubmissionKey(
    ...     'sample-submission')

  * reference to the librarian file.

    >>> print sample_submission.raw_submission
     <...LibraryFileAlias instance at ...>

  * date_created: Date and time of the submission (generated by the client).

    This value is not very reliable:
    * Some users do not care to set the correct time, date and time zone.
    * Some machines have a broken CMOS battery and the user does not set
      date and time after every boot.

    >>> print sample_submission.date_created
    2008-09-26 17:19:18+00:00

  * date_submitted: Date and time of the submission (generated by the server).

    >>> print sample_submission.date_submitted
    2008-09-30 08:19:00.222131+00:00

  * format: The format version of the submitted data, as given by the HWDB
    client. See HWSubmissionFormat for valid values.

    >>> print sample_submission.format.name
    VERSION_1

  * status: The status of the submission. See HWSubmissionProcessingStatus for
    valid values.

    >>> print sample_submission.status.name
    PROCESSED

  * private: If True, the submitter allows public access to the data. If
    false, the data may be used only for statistical purposes.

    >>> print sample_submission.private
    False

  * contactable: If True, the submitter agrees to be contacted by upstream
    developers and package maintainers for tests etc.

    >>> print sample_submission.contactable
    False

  * submission_key: A unique submission ID.

    >>> print sample_submission.submission_key
    sample-submission

  * raw_emailaddress: The email address of the submitter.

    >>> print sample_submission.raw_emailaddress
    test@canonical.com

  * owner: A reference to the Person table. This value is null, if the email
    address does not belong (yet) to an entry in Person table.

    >>> print sample_submission.owner.displayname
    Sample Person

  * distroarchseries: A reference to the distroarchseries of the submission.
    This value is null, if the submitted values for distribution,
    distroseries and architecture do not match an existing entry in the
    Distroarchrelease table.

    >>> print sample_submission.distroarchseries.architecturetag
    i386

    >>> print sample_submission.distroarchseries.distroseries.name
    hoary

    >>> print sample_submission.distroarchseries.distroseries.distribution.name
    ubuntu

  * system_fingerprint: A reference to an entry of the HWSystemFingerprint
    table. This table stores the system name as returned by HAL
    (system.vendor, system.product).

    >>> print sample_submission.system_fingerprint.fingerprint
    MSI MS-7369

  * devices: The set set of HWSubmissionDevice records which belong to
    this submission.

    Access to all data except submissions is restricted to members of
    the Canonical team.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> for submission_device in sample_submission.devices[:2]:
    ...     print submission_device.device.name
    MCP65 USB Controller
    MCP65 SATA Controller
    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)

Limitations:
  * "No name" products like mainboards from companies like ASRock
     or Asus that are directly sold to end users have fingerprints like
     "American Megatrends Inc. Unknown 1.0".
  * A manufacturer may erroneously assign identical DMI values for product
    and vendor to different systems.
  * submissions for "counterfeit systems".
  * users submitting bogus values using a patched HWDB client.

The system fingerprint is stored in a separate table, HWSystemFingerprint.
IHWSystemFingerPrintSet.createFingerprint creates a new row in this table.

    >>> from lp.hardwaredb.interfaces.hwdb import IHWSystemFingerprintSet
    >>> from storm.store import Store
    >>> hw_fingerprint_set = getUtility(IHWSystemFingerprintSet)
    >>> fp = hw_fingerprint_set.createFingerprint(u'IBM T41')
    >>> fp.fingerprint
    u'IBM T41'

Each fingerprint string in HWSystemFingerprint must be unique.

    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> fp = hw_fingerprint_set.createFingerprint(u'IBM T41')
    >>> Store.of(fp).flush()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    IntegrityError: ... violates unique constraint "hwsystemfingerprint...
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> transaction.abort()

IHWSystemFingerprint.getByName returns a fingerprint...

    >>> fp = hw_fingerprint_set.getByName(u'IBM T41')
    >>> fp.fingerprint
    u'IBM T41'

...or None, if no entry exists.

    >>> print hw_fingerprint_set.getByName(u'DEC PDP11')
    None

IHWSubmissionSet.createSubmission creates a new entry in the
HWSubmission table.

    >>> import pytz
    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> from lp.hardwaredb.interfaces.hwdb import (
    ...     HWSubmissionFormat,
    ...     IHWSubmissionSet,
    ...     )
    >>> date_created = datetime(2007, 04, 01, tzinfo=pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    >>> date_submitted = datetime(2007, 04, 02, tzinfo=pytz.timezone('UTC'))
    >>> submission_data = 'submission data'
    >>> hw_submission_set = getUtility(IHWSubmissionSet)
    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.createSubmission(
    ...     date_created=date_created,
    ...     format=HWSubmissionFormat.VERSION_1,
    ...     private=False,
    ...     contactable=False,
    ...     submission_key=u'unique-id-1',
    ...     emailaddress=u'test@canonical.com',
    ...     distroarchseries=None,
    ...     raw_submission=StringIO(submission_data),
    ...     filename=u'hwinfo.txt',
    ...     filesize=len(submission_data),
    ...     system_fingerprint=u'Dell Inspiron 1234')

submission_key must be unique. The attempt to create a HWSubmission entry
with an already existing submission_key raises HWSubmissionError.

    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.createSubmission(
    ...     date_created=date_created,
    ...     format=HWSubmissionFormat.VERSION_1,
    ...     private=False,
    ...     contactable=False,
    ...     submission_key=u'unique-id-1',
    ...     emailaddress=u'test@canonical.com',
    ...     distroarchseries=None,
    ...     raw_submission=StringIO(submission_data),
    ...     filename=u'hwinfo.txt',
    ...     filesize=len(submission_data),
    ...     system_fingerprint=u'Dell Inspiron 1234')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    HWSubmissionKeyNotUnique: A submission with this ID already exists

The field `owner` points to the Person record of the submitter, if the
submitted emailaddress belongs to an existing Launchpad account.

    >>> submission.owner.displayname
    u'Sample Person'

If no Person record is yet known for the submitter's email address,
the field `owner` is None.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> beeblebrox = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail(
    ...     'beeblebrox@example.com')
    >>> print beeblebrox
    None

    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.createSubmission(
    ...     date_created=date_created,
    ...     format=HWSubmissionFormat.VERSION_1,
    ...     private=False,
    ...     contactable=False,
    ...     submission_key=u'unique-id-2',
    ...     emailaddress=u'beeblebrox@example.com',
    ...     distroarchseries=None,
    ...     raw_submission=StringIO(submission_data),
    ...     filename=u'hwinfo.txt',
    ...     filesize=len(submission_data),
    ...     system_fingerprint=u'Acer 6789')
    >>> print submission.owner
    None

The submitted data can be retrieved via IHWSubmissionSet.getBySubmissionKey.

    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.getBySubmissionKey(u'unique-id-1')
    >>> submission.submission_key, submission.system_fingerprint.fingerprint
    (u'unique-id-1', u'Dell Inspiron 1234')

If a submission is marked as private, it is only returned by
IHWSubmissionSet.getBySubmissionKey if the parameter `user` matches the
owner of the submission...

    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.createSubmission(
    ...     date_created=date_created,
    ...     format=HWSubmissionFormat.VERSION_1,
    ...     private=True,
    ...     contactable=False,
    ...     submission_key=u'private-submission',
    ...     emailaddress=u'test@canonical.com',
    ...     distroarchseries=None,
    ...     raw_submission=StringIO(submission_data),
    ...     filename=u'hwinfo.txt',
    ...     filesize=len(submission_data),
    ...     system_fingerprint=u'Dell Inspiron 1234')
    >>> print hw_submission_set.getBySubmissionKey(u'private-submission')
    None
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person.displayname
    u'Sample Person'
    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.getBySubmissionKey(
    ...     u'private-submission', sample_person)
    >>> submission
    <HWSubmission at ...>

... or if `user` is an admin.

    >>> foobar = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.getBySubmissionKey(
    ...     u'private-submission', foobar)
    >>> submission
    <HWSubmission at ...>

Only the owner and admins can view the submission details.

    >>> submission.submission_key, submission.system_fingerprint.fingerprint
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: (...'submission_key', 'launchpad.View')

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> submission.submission_key, submission.system_fingerprint.fingerprint
    (u'private-submission', u'Dell Inspiron 1234')

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> submission.submission_key, submission.system_fingerprint.fingerprint
    (u'private-submission', u'Dell Inspiron 1234')

Passing another person than the owner or an admin as the parameter `user`
does not return private submissions.

    >>> no_priv = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> no_priv.displayname
    u'No Privileges Person'
    >>> print hw_submission_set.getBySubmissionKey(u'private-submission',
    ...     no_priv)
    None

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)

If no submission exists for a given ID, None is returned.

    >>> print hw_submission_set.getBySubmissionKey(u'unknown-ID')
    None

IHWSubmissionSet.getByFingerprintName returns all submissions for a
given fingerprint name. Private submissions are excluded, if the parameter
`user` is omitted or if user is neither the owner nor an admin.

    >>> submissions = hw_submission_set.getByFingerprintName(
    ...     u'Dell Inspiron 1234')
    >>> [(s.submission_key, s.system_fingerprint.fingerprint, s.private)
    ...  for s in submissions]
    [(u'unique-id-1', u'Dell Inspiron 1234', False)]
    >>> submissions = hw_submission_set.getByFingerprintName(
    ...     u'Dell Inspiron 1234', no_priv)
    >>> [(s.submission_key, s.system_fingerprint.fingerprint, s.private)
    ...  for s in submissions]
    [(u'unique-id-1', u'Dell Inspiron 1234', False)]
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> submissions = hw_submission_set.getByFingerprintName(
    ...     u'Dell Inspiron 1234', sample_person)
    >>> [(s.submission_key, s.system_fingerprint.fingerprint, s.private)
    ...  for s in submissions]
    [(u'private-submission', u'Dell Inspiron 1234', True),
     (u'unique-id-1', u'Dell Inspiron 1234', False)]
    >>> submissions = hw_submission_set.getByFingerprintName(
    ...     u'Dell Inspiron 1234', foobar)
    >>> [(s.submission_key, s.system_fingerprint.fingerprint, s.private)
    ...  for s in submissions]
    [(u'private-submission', u'Dell Inspiron 1234', True),
     (u'unique-id-1', u'Dell Inspiron 1234', False)]

If no submissions exist for the given system fingerprint, an empty result
set is returned.

    >>> list(hw_submission_set.getByFingerprintName('DEC PDP11'))
    []

IHWSubmissionSet.getByOwner returns all submissions of a person. Again,
only non-private submissions are returned if no parameter `user` is passed
to the method, or if the passed parameter is neither the owner nor an admin.

    >>> submissions = hw_submission_set.getByOwner(sample_person)
    >>> [(s.submission_key, s.system_fingerprint.fingerprint)
    ...  for s in submissions]
    [(u'unique-id-1', u'Dell Inspiron 1234'),
     (u'sample-submission', u'MSI MS-7369'),
     (u'test_submission_id_1', u'TONKA TUFFBOOK2600')]
    >>> submissions = hw_submission_set.getByOwner(sample_person,
    ...                                            user=no_priv)
    >>> [(s.submission_key, s.system_fingerprint.fingerprint)
    ...  for s in submissions]
    [(u'unique-id-1', u'Dell Inspiron 1234'),
     (u'sample-submission', u'MSI MS-7369'),
     (u'test_submission_id_1', u'TONKA TUFFBOOK2600')]
    >>> submissions = hw_submission_set.getByOwner(sample_person,
    ...                                            user=sample_person)
    >>> [(s.submission_key, s.system_fingerprint.fingerprint)
    ...  for s in submissions]
    [(u'private-submission', u'Dell Inspiron 1234'),
     (u'unique-id-1', u'Dell Inspiron 1234'),
     (u'sample-submission', u'MSI MS-7369'),
     (u'test_submission_id_1', u'TONKA TUFFBOOK2600')]
    >>> submissions = hw_submission_set.getByOwner(sample_person,
    ...                                            user=foobar)
    >>> [(s.submission_key, s.system_fingerprint.fingerprint)
    ...  for s in submissions]
    [(u'private-submission', u'Dell Inspiron 1234'),
     (u'unique-id-1', u'Dell Inspiron 1234'),
     (u'sample-submission', u'MSI MS-7369'),
     (u'test_submission_id_1', u'TONKA TUFFBOOK2600')]

When an anonymous submitter later registers a Launchpad account, the field
`owner` is updated.

    >>> from lp.services.identity.interfaces.emailaddress import IEmailAddressSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import PersonCreationRationale
    >>> user = getUtility(IPersonSet).ensurePerson(
    ...     u'beeblebrox@example.com', u'Beeblebrox',
    ...     PersonCreationRationale.OWNER_CREATED_LAUNCHPAD)
    >>> email = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet).getByEmail(
    ...     u'beeblebrox@example.com')
    >>> user.validateAndEnsurePreferredEmail(email)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> from lp.scripts.garbo import HWSubmissionEmailLinker
    >>> from lp.services.log.logger import DevNullLogger
    >>> HWSubmissionEmailLinker(log=DevNullLogger()).run()
    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.getBySubmissionKey(u'unique-id-2')
    >>> print submission.owner.displayname
    Beeblebrox

If somebody has a Launchpad account, but submits HWDB test data using
an email address which he has not added to his account, the submission
will have the `owner` field set to None.

    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.createSubmission(
    ...     date_created=date_created,
    ...     format=HWSubmissionFormat.VERSION_1,
    ...     private=False,
    ...     contactable=False,
    ...     submission_key=u'unique-id-4',
    ...     emailaddress=u'beeblebrox@beeblebrox.net',
    ...     distroarchseries=None,
    ...     raw_submission=StringIO(submission_data),
    ...     filename=u'hwinfo.txt',
    ...     filesize=len(submission_data),
    ...     system_fingerprint=u'Acer 6789')
    >>> Store.of(submission).flush()
    >>> print submission.owner
    None

When he adds this email address to his list of addresses in Launchpad,
the field `owner` is updated.

    >>> email = getUtility(IEmailAddressSet).new(
    ...     u'beeblebrox@beeblebrox.net', user)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> ignored = login_person(user)
    >>> user.validateAndEnsurePreferredEmail(email)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> HWSubmissionEmailLinker(log=DevNullLogger()).run()
    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.getBySubmissionKey(u'unique-id-2')
    >>> print submission.owner.displayname
    Beeblebrox

=== Submission Records without an email address ===

A submission does not necessarily have an email address (anonymous
submission). In this case the owner is always None.

    >>> submission_no_owner = hw_submission_set.createSubmission(
    ...     date_created=date_created,
    ...     format=HWSubmissionFormat.VERSION_1,
    ...     private=False,
    ...     contactable=False,
    ...     submission_key=u'unique-id-5',
    ...     emailaddress=None,
    ...     distroarchseries=None,
    ...     raw_submission=StringIO(submission_data),
    ...     filename=u'hwinfo.txt',
    ...     filesize=len(submission_data),
    ...     system_fingerprint=u'Dell Inspiron 1234')
    >>> Store.of(submission_no_owner).flush()
    >>> print submission_no_owner.raw_emailaddress
    None
    >>> print submission_no_owner.owner
    None

== Retrieving Submissions by Status ==

The set of submissions with a given status can be retrieved by
IHWSubmissionSet.getByStatus(). Only the publicly visible
submissions are returned if no user is specified.

    >>> from lp.hardwaredb.interfaces.hwdb import (
    ...     HWSubmissionProcessingStatus)
    >>> def print_submissions(submissions):
    ...     for submission in submissions:
    ...         print submission.submission_key, submission.private,
    ...         if submission.owner is not None:
    ...             print submission.owner.displayname,
    ...         else:
    ...             print '(no owner)',
    ...         print submission.status.name
    >>> new_submissions = hw_submission_set.getByStatus(
    ...     HWSubmissionProcessingStatus.SUBMITTED)
    >>> print_submissions(new_submissions)
    test_submission_id_1 False Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-1 False Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-2 False Beeblebrox SUBMITTED
    unique-id-4 False Beeblebrox SUBMITTED
    unique-id-5 False (no owner) SUBMITTED

If a user is passed, private submissions of this user are returned too.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> from lp.hardwaredb.interfaces.hwdb import (
    ...     HWSubmissionProcessingStatus)
    >>> new_submissions = hw_submission_set.getByStatus(
    ...     HWSubmissionProcessingStatus.SUBMITTED, user=sample_person)
    >>> print_submissions(new_submissions)
    test_submission_id_1 False Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-1 False Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-2 False Beeblebrox SUBMITTED
    private-submission True Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-4 False Beeblebrox SUBMITTED
    unique-id-5 False (no owner) SUBMITTED

Submissions of other users are not returned.

    >>> from lp.hardwaredb.interfaces.hwdb import (
    ...     HWSubmissionProcessingStatus)
    >>> new_submissions = hw_submission_set.getByStatus(
    ...     HWSubmissionProcessingStatus.SUBMITTED, user=no_priv)
    >>> print_submissions(new_submissions)
    test_submission_id_1 False Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-1 False Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-2 False Beeblebrox SUBMITTED
    unique-id-4 False Beeblebrox SUBMITTED
    unique-id-5 False (no owner) SUBMITTED

For admins, IHWSubmissionSet.getByStatus() returns private and public
submissions...

    >>> foobar = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> from lp.hardwaredb.interfaces.hwdb import (
    ...     HWSubmissionProcessingStatus)
    >>> new_submissions = hw_submission_set.getByStatus(
    ...     HWSubmissionProcessingStatus.SUBMITTED, user=foobar)
    >>> print_submissions(new_submissions)
    test_submission_id_1 False Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-1 False Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-2 False Beeblebrox SUBMITTED
    private-submission True Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-4 False Beeblebrox SUBMITTED
    unique-id-5 False (no owner) SUBMITTED

...as well as for the janitor.

    >>> from lp.app.interfaces.launchpad import ILaunchpadCelebrities
    >>> janitor = getUtility(ILaunchpadCelebrities).janitor
    >>> new_submissions = hw_submission_set.getByStatus(
    ...     HWSubmissionProcessingStatus.SUBMITTED, user=janitor)
    >>> print_submissions(new_submissions)
    test_submission_id_1 False Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-1 False Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-2 False Beeblebrox SUBMITTED
    private-submission True Sample Person SUBMITTED
    unique-id-4 False Beeblebrox SUBMITTED
    unique-id-5 False (no owner) SUBMITTED

Searching for other statuses is possible too.

    >>> submission_no_owner.status = HWSubmissionProcessingStatus.PROCESSED
    >>> processed_submissions = hw_submission_set.getByStatus(
    ...     HWSubmissionProcessingStatus.PROCESSED, user=foobar)
    >>> print_submissions(processed_submissions)
    sample-submission False Sample Person PROCESSED
    unique-id-5 False (no owner) PROCESSED

== Links to Bugs ==

HWDB submissions can be linked to bugs. These links are created by
IHWSubmissionBugSet.create().

    >>> from lp.bugs.interfaces.bug import IBugSet
    >>> from lp.hardwaredb.interfaces.hwdb import IHWSubmissionBugSet
    >>> bug_one = getUtility(IBugSet).get(1)
    >>> submission_bug_set = getUtility(IHWSubmissionBugSet)
    >>> submission_bug = submission_bug_set.create(
    ...     submission_no_owner, bug_one)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> print submission_bug.submission.submission_key
    unique-id-5
    >>> submission_bug.bug.id
    1

Links between a bug and a submission are unique. If we call
IHWSubmissionBugSet.create() twice for the same bug and HWDB submission,
the method returns the existing record.

    >>> second_link = submission_bug_set.create(submission_no_owner, bug_one)
    >>> second_link.id == submission_bug.id
    True

HWSubmissionBugSet.submissionsForBug() returns all submissions linked to
a given bug.

    >>> for submission in submission_bug_set.submissionsForBug(bug_one):
    ...     print submission.submission_key
    unique-id-5

Private submissions are only returned if the current user is an admin
or the owner of the private submission.

    >>> submission = hw_submission_set.getBySubmissionKey(
    ...     u'private-submission', sample_person)
    >>> submission_bug_set.create(submission, bug_one)
    <HWSubmissionBug at...
    >>> for submission in submission_bug_set.submissionsForBug(
    ...     bug_one, user=sample_person):
    ...     print submission.submission_key
    private-submission
    unique-id-5

    >>> for submission in submission_bug_set.submissionsForBug(
    ...     bug_one, user=foobar):
    ...     print submission.submission_key
    private-submission
    unique-id-5

Other registered persons can see only public submissions...

    >>> for submission in submission_bug_set.submissionsForBug(
    ...     bug_one, user=no_priv):
    ...     print submission.submission_key

== General Search Method ==

IHWSubmissionSet.search() allows the look up of submissions which
contain a specfic device, a specific driver or which are made for a
specific distribution or processor architecture.

All parameters are optional; if none are given, all publicly visible
submissions are returned.

    >>> for submission in hw_submission_set.search():
    ...     print submission.submission_key
    test_submission_id_1
    sample-submission
    unique-id-1
    unique-id-2
    unique-id-4
    unique-id-5

If the parameter `user` is specified, private submissions from this user
are returned too.

    >>> for submission in hw_submission_set.search(user=sample_person):
    ...     print submission.submission_key
    test_submission_id_1
    sample-submission
    unique-id-1
    unique-id-2
    private-submission
    unique-id-4
    unique-id-5

Admins have access to all submissions.

    >>> for submission in hw_submission_set.search(user=foobar):
    ...     print submission.submission_key
    test_submission_id_1
    sample-submission
    unique-id-1
    unique-id-2
    private-submission
    unique-id-4
    unique-id-5

If a distribution is specified, only those submissions that were made
for that distribution are returned.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import (
    ...     IDistributionSet)
    >>> distribution_set = getUtility(IDistributionSet)
    >>> ubuntu = distribution_set.getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> for submission in hw_submission_set.search(distribution=ubuntu):
    ...     print submission.submission_key
    sample-submission

    >>> debian = distribution_set.getByName('debian')
    >>> print hw_submission_set.search(distribution=debian).count()
    0

If an architecture is specified, only those submissions that were made
for that architecture are returned.

    >>> for submission in hw_submission_set.search(architecture='i386'):
    ...     print submission.submission_key
    sample-submission

    >>> print hw_submission_set.search(architecture='amd64').count()
    0


If a device is specified, only those submissions that include
the device are returned.

    >>> from lp.hardwaredb.interfaces.hwdb import HWBus, IHWDeviceSet
    >>> device_set = getUtility(IHWDeviceSet)
    >>> msi_mainboard = device_set.getByDeviceID(
    ...     HWBus.SYSTEM, 'MSI', 'MS-7369')
    >>> for submission in hw_submission_set.search(device=msi_mainboard):
    ...     print submission.submission_key
    sample-submission

If a driver is specified, only those submissions for that driver
are returned.

    >>> from lp.hardwaredb.interfaces.hwdb import IHWDriverSet
    >>> driver_set = getUtility(IHWDriverSet)
    >>> ehci_driver = driver_set.getByPackageAndName(
    ...     'linux-image-2.6.24-19-generic', 'ehci_hcd')
    >>> for submission in hw_submission_set.search(driver=ehci_driver):
    ...     print submission.submission_key
    sample-submission

If a distroseries is specified, only submissions for that distroseries
are returned.

    >>> from lp.testing.factory import LaunchpadObjectFactory
    >>> factory = LaunchpadObjectFactory()

    >>> warty = ubuntu['warty']
    >>> warty_arch_series = factory.makeDistroArchSeries(distroseries=warty)
    >>> submission = factory.makeHWSubmission(distroarchseries=warty_arch_series)
    >>> for submission in hw_submission_set.search(distroseries=warty):
    ...     print submission.distroarchseries.distroseries.name
    warty

It is also possible to search for a distroseries and architecture.

    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.processor import IProcessorSet
    >>> amd64 = getUtility(IProcessorSet).getByName('amd64')
    >>> warty_amd64 = factory.makeDistroArchSeries(
    ...     distroseries=warty, architecturetag='amd64',
    ...     processor=amd64)
    >>> submission = factory.makeHWSubmission(distroarchseries=warty_amd64)
    >>> for submission in hw_submission_set.search(distroseries=warty, architecture='amd64'):
    ...     print '%s %s ' % (
    ...         submission.distroarchseries.distroseries.name,
    ...         submission.distroarchseries.architecturetag)
    warty amd64

And we can also search for submissions from a particular user.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> owner = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name12')
    >>> set(submission.owner.name for submission
    ...     in hw_submission_set.search(owner=owner))
    set([u'name12'])

Alternatively, we can get the same result by looking at
IPerson.hardware_submissions.

    >>> set(submission.owner.name for submission
    ...     in owner.hardware_submissions)
    set([u'name12'])
