We have a command line script that can be used to close accounts.

Unfortunately, we have no way of detecting schema updates containing new
information that needs to be removed or sanitized on account closure apart
from reviewers noticing and prompting developers to update this script.

See Bug #120506 for more details.


Get Mark's account and person entries.
>>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
>>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
>>> mark_person = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('mark@example.com')
>>> mark_account = removeSecurityProxy(mark_person.account)


Mark's account is active and contains personal information.

>>> print mark_account.status.name
ACTIVE
>>> print mark_account.displayname
Mark Shuttleworth
>>> print mark_person.name
mark
>>> print mark_person.displayname
Mark Shuttleworth


Store the id's so we can retrieve the records later.

>>> mark_person_id = mark_person.id
>>> mark_account_id = mark_account.id


Lets close his account.

>>> import os.path
>>> from lp.services.config import config
>>> from lp.testing.script import run_script
>>> script = os.path.join(config.root, 'scripts', 'close-account.py')
>>> (result, out, err) = run_script(script, args=['mark@example.com'])
>>> print result
0
>>> print out
>>> print err
INFO...Closing mark's account


Now, start a new transaction so we can see the changes the script made.

>>> from lp.testing.layers import LaunchpadZopelessLayer
>>> LaunchpadZopelessLayer.abort()


We can't just set the account to DEACTIVATED, as the close-account.py
script is used to satisty people who insist on us removing all their
personal details from our system. The Account has been removed entirely.

>>> from lp.services.identity.model.account import Account
>>> Account.get(mark_account_id)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
SQLObjectNotFound: ...


The Person record still exists to maintain links with information that won't
be removed, such as bug comments, but has been anonymized.

>>> from lp.registry.model.person import Person
>>> mark_person = Person.get(mark_person_id)
>>> print mark_person.name
removed...
>>> print mark_person.displayname
Removed by request


Flag the database as dirty since it has been modified without the test suite
knowing.

>>> from lp.testing.layers import DatabaseLayer
>>> DatabaseLayer.force_dirty_database()
