= Empty source package branch listings =

When you look at an empty source package branch listing, you see some nice,
helpful text.

Let's demonstrate this by making a source package with no branches and
browsing to it.

    >>> from lp.registry.model.sourcepackage import SourcePackage
    >>> def make_source_package(distro, series, name):
    ...     distro = factory.makeDistribution(name=distro, displayname=distro)
    ...     distroseries = factory.makeDistroSeries(
    ...         name=series, distribution=distro)
    ...     sourcepackagename = factory.makeSourcePackageName(name=name)
    ...     return SourcePackage(sourcepackagename, distroseries)

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> source_package = make_source_package('distro', 'series', 'foo')
    >>> source_package_url = canonical_url(source_package, rootsite='code')
    >>> logout()

This takes us to the branch listing for that source package

    >>> browser.open(source_package_url)

Since there are no branches, there is no branch listing table:

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'branchtable')
    None

    >>> print_tag_with_id(browser.contents, 'branch-summary')
    There are no branches of foo in distro Series in Launchpad.

Listings of distribution source packages also just show a message.

    >>> browser.open("http://code.launchpad.dev/distro/+source/foo")

Since there are no branches, there is no branch listing table:

    >>> print find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'branchtable')
    None

    >>> print repr(extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'branch-summary')))
    u'There are no branches for the \u201cfoo\u201d package
    in distro\nin Launchpad.'

    >>> print_tag_with_id(browser.contents, 'distro-branch-warning')
    This page is for a packaging branch for a program in
    distro. Changes
    should be made here to
    distro packaging or
    for changes specific to
    distro's
    needs. Changes to the program in general should be made on the
    upstream branch
    which is not currently known to Launchpad.
