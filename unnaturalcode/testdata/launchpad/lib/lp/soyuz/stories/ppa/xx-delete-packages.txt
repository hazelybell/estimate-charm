PPA package deletion
====================

The PPA 'Delete packages' view allows users to delete packages form
their PPAs via the web UI. Only the owner of the PPA and Launchpad
administrators may access this page.

Anonymous and an ordinary user cannot access Celso's PPA package
console, even if they try the URL directly.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+packages')
    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Delete packages').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+delete-packages')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ..., 'launchpad.Edit')

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+packages')
    >>> user_browser.getLink('Delete packages').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...    'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+delete-packages')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    Unauthorized: ..., 'launchpad.Edit')

Only Celso and Foo bar can access the 'Delete packages' page for
Celso's PPA.

    >>> cprov_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth="Basic celso.providelo@canonical.com:test")
    >>> cprov_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+packages')
    >>> cprov_browser.getLink('Delete packages').click()
    >>> print cprov_browser.title
    Delete packages from PPA for Celso Providelo...

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+packages')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Delete packages').click()
    >>> print admin_browser.title
    Delete packages from PPA for Celso Providelo...

Once accessed the page provides a way to search for published package
sources and optionally delete one or more matching packages via POST
form.

When the 'Delete packages' page is loaded a list of all published
sources is presented,

    >>> print_ppa_packages(admin_browser.contents)
    Source            Published   Status     Series          Section  Build
        Status

    pmount - 0.1-1    2007-07-09  Published  Warty           Editors

An informational message also directs the user to the PPA help page
via a link:

    >>> admin_browser.getLink('PPA help page').url
    'https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA'

The user can update the form to only list published sources with name
matching the given text.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.name_filter').value = 'nonexistentpackage'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Filter").click()
    >>> print_ppa_packages(admin_browser.contents)
    No matching package for 'nonexistentpackage'.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.name_filter').value = 'pmount'
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Filter").click()
    >>> print_ppa_packages(admin_browser.contents)
    Source           Published   Status     Series          Section  Build

The user may delete packages from a PPA without providing a reason
(deletion comment). Let's try it on mark's archive.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~mark/+archive/ppa/+packages')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Delete packages').click()
    >>> print_ppa_packages(admin_browser.contents)
    Source            Published   Status     Series          Section  Build
        Status
    iceweasel...(...) 2007-07-09  Published  Breezy-autotest Editors

Please note that the 'deletion_comment' field (which is optional) is empty.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl('Deletion comment').value
    ''

    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name='field.name_filter').value = ''
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name='field.selected_sources').value = ['31']
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Request Deletion").click()
    >>> print_feedback_messages(admin_browser.contents)
    Source and binaries deleted by Foo Bar:
    iceweasel 1.0 in breezy-autotest
    Deletion comment: None

The single package in mark's archive was deleted successfully.

    >>> print_ppa_packages(admin_browser.contents)
    Source             Published   Status     Series   Section  Build Status
    iceweasel...(...)  2007-07-09  Deleted    ...

Now back to cprov's archive for the remaining tests.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+packages')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Delete packages').click()

Deletion requires, at least, one selected a source, otherwise an error
is issued.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Deletion comment").value = "DO IT"
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Request Deletion").click()
    >>> print_feedback_messages(admin_browser.contents)
    There is 1 error.
    No sources selected.

Once the deletion is successfully requested, Foo Bar sees an
informational message containing the summary of the action
performed. The results should not include the just-deleted source.

Note that we will also include a unquoted portion of text in the
deletion comment, simulating a XSS attack. The current code will
automaticaly quote the text entered by the user resulting in an
entirely readable content.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Filter").click()
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(name='field.selected_sources').value = ['27']
    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...     "Deletion comment").value = "DO <where is my XSS ?> IT"
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Request Deletion").click()

    >>> print_feedback_messages(admin_browser.contents)
    Source and binaries deleted by Foo Bar:
    cdrkit 1.0 in breezy-autotest
    Deletion comment: DO &lt;where is my XSS ?&gt; IT

    >>> print_ppa_packages(admin_browser.contents)

    pmount - 0.1-1     2007-07-09  Published  Warty    Editors

Here we can check for maliciously submitted forms containing
invalid data.

An nonexistent source:

    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.selected_sources').value = ['100']
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ItemNotFoundError: insufficient items with name '100'

An invalid value.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.selected_sources').value = ['blah']
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ItemNotFoundError: insufficient items with name 'blah'

The deleted record is now presented accordingly in the +index page. We
will use another browser to inspect the results of our deletions.

    >>> cprov_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+packages')
    >>> print_ppa_packages(cprov_browser.contents)

Before deleting the remaining sources we will save a in this state for
the form re-submission tests.

    >>> re_post_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth="Basic foo.bar@canonical.com:test")
    >>> re_post_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+packages')
    >>> re_post_browser.getLink('Delete packages').click()

Multiple packages can be deleted in one single batch.

    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Filter").click()

    >>> admin_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.selected_sources').value = ['28', '29']
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Deletion comment").value = "DO IT AGAIN !"
    >>> admin_browser.getControl("Request Deletion").click()

    >>> print_feedback_messages(admin_browser.contents)
    Source and binaries deleted by Foo Bar:

    >>> from lp.services.database.constants import UTC_NOW
    >>> from lp.services.database.interfaces import IStore
    >>> from lp.soyuz.model.publishing import SourcePackagePublishingHistory
    >>> IStore(SourcePackagePublishingHistory).find(
    ...     SourcePackagePublishingHistory,
    ...     SourcePackagePublishingHistory.id.is_in([27, 28, 29])).set(
    ...         scheduleddeletiondate=UTC_NOW)
    >>> transaction.commit()

The page doesn't present the form anymore, since there are no sources
available for deletion.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~cprov/+archive/ppa/+delete-packages')
    >>> main_content = find_main_content(admin_browser.contents)
    >>> print extract_text(
    ...   find_tags_by_class(str(main_content), 'top-portlet')[0])
    This PPA does not contain any source packages published.

All the packages were deleted via the admin_browser, now we will
re-POST the same deletion request via the browser saved in the
previous state to check if the bug 185922 is really fixed.

    >>> re_post_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.selected_sources').value = ['28', '29']
    >>> re_post_browser.getControl("Deletion comment").value = "DO IT AGAIN !"
    >>> re_post_browser.getControl("Request Deletion").click()

    There is 1 error.

Any user can see that all packages present in Celso's PPA are deleted.

    >>> cprov_browser.getControl(

    >>> cprov_browser.getControl('Filter', index=0).click()

PPAs that don't contain any published source packages, do not present
the 'Delete packages' link.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv/+archive/ppa/+packages')
    >>> admin_browser.getLink('Delete packages').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError

Even when accessed manually the 'Delete packages' form is not rendered
for PPAs that do not contain any published packages, instead a clear
message is presented.

    >>> admin_browser.open(
    ...    'http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv/+archive/ppa/+delete-packages')
    >>> print admin_browser.title
    Delete packages from PPA for No Privileges Person...

    >>> print extract_text(find_main_content(admin_browser.contents))
    Delete packages from PPA for No Privileges Person
    ...
    This PPA does not contain any source packages published.

Removing source partially deleted
---------------------------------

The 'delete-packages' interface should allow users to enforce removal
of packages partially removed or superseded. It happens, for instance,
when:

 1. A source got deleted before it was completely built;

 2. The new source version in the series builds a smaller set of
    binaries than the previous version.

In order to reproduce this we will use SoyuzTestPublisher to create a
SUPERSEDED source with a PUBLISHED binary in No Privileged Person's PPA.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility

    >>> from lp.services.database.constants import UTC_NOW
    >>> from lp.services.librarian.interfaces import ILibraryFileAliasSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from lp.soyuz.enums import PackagePublishingStatus
    >>> from lp.soyuz.tests.test_publishing import SoyuzTestPublisher

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> hoary = ubuntu.getSeries('hoary')

    >>> fake_chroot = getUtility(ILibraryFileAliasSet)[1]
    >>> trash = hoary["i386"].addOrUpdateChroot(fake_chroot)

    >>> test_publisher = SoyuzTestPublisher()

    >>> no_priv = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('no-priv')
    >>> name16 = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('name16')
    >>> test_publisher.person = name16

    >>> foo_pub_src = test_publisher.getPubSource(
    ...     version="1.0", architecturehintlist='i386',
    ...     distroseries=hoary, archive=no_priv.archive,
    ...     status=PackagePublishingStatus.SUPERSEDED)
    >>> foo_pub_src.datesuperseded = UTC_NOW
    >>> foo_pub_src.datemadepending = UTC_NOW

    >>> foo_pub_binaries = test_publisher.getPubBinaries(
    ...     distroseries=hoary, pub_source=foo_pub_src,
    ...     status=PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED)

    >>> logout()
    >>> import transaction
    >>> transaction.commit()

The SUPERSEDED source we have just added is listed in the PPA
overview page.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/~no-priv/+archive/ppa/+packages')
    >>> user_browser.getControl(
    ...    name='field.status_filter').value = ['superseded']
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Filter', index=0).click()
    >>> print_ppa_packages(user_browser.contents)

We don't show the publishing details for binary packages, but the
presence of 'Built packages' and the binary filename in the 'Files'
section indicates to the user that it is still published.

    >>> expander_url = user_browser.getLink(
    ...     id='pub%s-expander' % foo_pub_src.id).url
    >>> anon_browser.open(expander_url)

Even if the source added is recorded as SUPERSEDED, it is still
available for deletion because it contains a PUBLISHED binary.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('Delete packages').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title

The list of 'deletable' sources can be filtered by status. The default
filter is 'Any Status', but the user can choose another.

    >>> print user_browser.getControl(name='field.status_filter').value
    ['']

When the user selects 'Published' filter and update the results, no
records are presented.

    >>> user_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.status_filter').value = ['published']
    >>> user_browser.getControl("Filter").click()
    >>> print_ppa_packages(user_browser.contents)
    No matching package for ''.

When he selects 'Superseded' the SUPERSEDED source shows up again.

    >>> user_browser.getControl(
    ...     name='field.status_filter').value = ['superseded']
    >>> user_browser.getControl("Filter").click()
    >>> print_ppa_packages(user_browser.contents)

The deletion works exactly as it does for PUBLISHED sources, both,
source and binaries are marked as DELETED and the corresponding
'datesuperseded' as set to 'now'.

    >>> deletion_comment = (
    ...     "Deletion of a number of base pairs that is not evenly "
    ...     "divisible by three will lead to a frameshift mutation.")
    >>> user_browser.getControl(

After the deletion, any user accessing No-privileges' PPA page can see
a row representing 'foo' and it is marked as 'superseded'. In its
corresponding expandable area, he can see that the 'Built packages'
section is omitted, however the source and binary files can be
downloaded from librarian.

Please note also how the deletion comment is diplayed in its entirety as
opposed to being truncated after the first 20 characters.

    >>> user_browser.open(

Once a deleted package gets removed from disk we render a message in
the "Publishing Status" section pointing to the users that even if the
package files were removed from the archive disk, it is still possible
to download them directly from librarian and the links are below.

Remove the just deleted publication from disk setting its
'dateremoved' attribute.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> no_priv = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('no-priv')
    >>> deleted_pub = no_priv.archive.getPublishedSources(
