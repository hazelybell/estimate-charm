Introduction
============

Launchpad provides two ways to programmatically interact with your
branches. You can either interact with the branches themselves using
`bzrlib`, or you can use Launchpad's webservice APIs to explore
information about the branches and how they relate to the rest of
the things on Launchpad.

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> import pytz
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> from lp.code.enums import BranchLifecycleStatus, BranchType
    >>> from lazr.restful.marshallers import DateTimeFieldMarshaller
    >>> from lp.code.interfaces.branch import IBranch

To make this document a little more readable, we'll have to define some
helpers. This one turns a JSON date/time response into a Python
`datetime` object.

    >>> def get_as_datetime(response):
    ...     """Return a datetime object from a JSON response."""
    ...     returned_time = response.jsonBody()
    ...     marshaller = DateTimeFieldMarshaller(
    ...         IBranch['next_mirror_time'], response)
    ...     return marshaller.marshall_from_json_data(returned_time)


Requesting a mirror
===================

Many of the branches on Launchpad are mirrored branches: branches that
are hosted on other servers and then mirrored regularly by Launchpad's
branch puller.

Normally, the puller fetches branches every six hours or so. However,
it also provides a way for you to request that a mirror be done
immediately.

Let's make a mirrored branch to play with:

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> branch = removeSecurityProxy(
    ...     factory.makeAnyBranch(branch_type=BranchType.MIRRORED))
    >>> logout()

At the moment, it's not scheduled to be mirrored.

    >>> print branch.next_mirror_time
    None

But we can ask for it to be mirrored using the webservice:

    >>> branch_url = '/' + branch.unique_name
    >>> start_time = datetime.now(pytz.UTC)
    >>> response = webservice.named_post(branch_url, 'requestMirror')
    >>> end_time = datetime.now(pytz.UTC)
    >>> new_mirror_time = get_as_datetime(response)
    >>> branch.next_mirror_time == new_mirror_time
    True

The new "next mirror time" is the time when we actually submitted the
request for a mirror:

    >>> print start_time < branch.next_mirror_time < end_time
    True


Basic branch attributes
=======================

Not everything about a branch is exposed.  Hopefully most of what users
really care about is exposed, and we will undoubtedly expand this as
time goes on.

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> eric = factory.makePerson(name='eric')
    >>> marley = factory.makePerson(name='marley')
    >>> fooix = factory.makeProduct(name='fooix')
    >>> branch = factory.makeProductBranch(
    ...     branch_type=BranchType.HOSTED, owner=eric, product=fooix,
    ...     name='trunk', title='The Fooix Trunk',
    ...     date_created=datetime(2009, 1, 1, tzinfo=pytz.UTC))
    >>> feature_branch = factory.makeAnyBranch(
    ...     owner=eric, product=fooix, name='feature-branch',
    ...     lifecycle_status=BranchLifecycleStatus.EXPERIMENTAL)
    >>> feature_branch_bug = factory.makeBug(target=fooix,
    ...     title='Stuff needs features')
    >>> feature_branch_spec = factory.makeSpecification(product=fooix,
    ...     title='Super Feature X')
    >>> merge_proposal = factory.makeBranchMergeProposal(
    ...     target_branch=branch, source_branch=feature_branch,
    ...     registrant=eric)
    >>> branch_url = '/' + branch.unique_name
    >>> feature_branch_url = '/' + feature_branch.unique_name
    >>> feature_branch_bug_url = '/bugs/' + str(feature_branch_bug.id)
    >>> feature_branch_spec_url = '/' + '/'.join([
    ...     feature_branch_spec.product.name,
    ...     '+spec',
    ...     feature_branch_spec.name])
    >>> logout()

    >>> from lp.testing.pages import webservice_for_person
    >>> service = webservice_for_person(eric)
    >>> fooix_trunk = webservice.get(branch_url).jsonBody()
    >>> from lazr.restful.testing.webservice import pprint_entry
    >>> pprint_entry(fooix_trunk)

There is a branch merge proposal with Fooix trunk as the target branch, so it
should have a branch at the endpoint of landing_candidates.

    >>> landing_candidates = webservice.get(
    ...     fooix_trunk['landing_candidates_collection_link']).jsonBody()
    >>> for candidate in landing_candidates['entries']:
    ...     print candidate['source_branch_link']
    http://.../~eric/fooix/feature-branch


The source_branch of the landing candidate should have this same merge proposal
in its landing_targets.

    >>> feature_branch_link = \
    ...     '/~eric/fooix/feature-branch'
    >>> feature_branch = webservice.get(feature_branch_link).jsonBody()
    >>> print feature_branch['unique_name']
    ~eric/fooix/feature-branch

    >>> landing_targets = webservice.get(
    ...     feature_branch['landing_targets_collection_link']).jsonBody()
    >>> for target in landing_targets['entries']:
    ...     print target['target_branch_link']
    http://.../~eric/fooix/trunk

The isPersonTrustedReviewer method is exposed, and takes a person link.

    >>> trusted = webservice.named_get(
    ...     feature_branch['self_link'], 'isPersonTrustedReviewer',
    ...     reviewer=feature_branch['owner_link']).jsonBody()
    >>> print trusted
    True


Project branches
================

The branches of a project are also available.

    >>> def print_branch(branch):
    ...     print branch['unique_name'] + ' - ' + branch['lifecycle_status']
    >>> def print_branches(webservice, url, status=None, modified_since=None):
    ...     branches = webservice.named_get(
    ...         url, 'getBranches',
    ...         status=status, modified_since=modified_since).jsonBody()
    ...     for branch in branches['entries']:
    ...         print_branch(branch)

    >>> print_branches(webservice, '/fooix')
    ~eric/fooix/trunk - Development
    ~eric/fooix/feature-branch - Experimental

The branches can be limited to those that have been modified since a specified
time.

    >>> print_branches(webservice, '/fooix',
    ...                modified_since=u'2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00')
    ~eric/fooix/feature-branch - Experimental

A list of lifecycle statuses can be provided for filtering.

    >>> print_branches(webservice, '/fooix', ('Experimental'))
    ~eric/fooix/feature-branch - Experimental

Branches for people
===================

The branches owned by a person are available from the person object.

    >>> print_branches(webservice, '/~eric')
    ~eric/fooix/trunk - Development
    ~eric/fooix/feature-branch - Experimental

As with projects, these can be filtered by the branch status.

    >>> print_branches(webservice, '/~eric', ('Experimental'))
    ~eric/fooix/feature-branch - Experimental

Project group branches
======================

Branches are also accessible for a project group.

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> project = factory.makeProject(name='widgets')
    >>> fooix.project = project
    >>> blob = factory.makeProduct(name='blob', project=project)
    >>> branch = factory.makeProductBranch(product=blob, name='bar')
    >>> branch.owner.name = 'mary'
    >>> logout()

    >>> print_branches(webservice, '/widgets')
    ~eric/fooix/trunk - Development
    ~eric/fooix/feature-branch - Experimental
    ~mary/blob/bar - Development

As with projects, these can be filtered by the branch status.

    >>> print_branches(webservice, '/widgets', ('Experimental'))
    ~eric/fooix/feature-branch - Experimental

Differences between versions
============================

In version 'beta', a branch can be made private or public by invoking
the named operation 'setPrivate'.

    >>> branch = webservice.get(branch_url).jsonBody()
    >>> print branch['private']
    False

    >>> response = webservice.named_post(
    ...     branch_url, 'setPrivate', api_version='beta', private=True)
    >>> branch = webservice.get(branch_url).jsonBody()
    >>> print branch['information_type']
    Private

In subsequent versions, 'setPrivate' is gone; you have to use the
'transitionToInformationType' method.

    >>> print webservice.named_post(
    ...     branch_url, 'setPrivate', api_version='devel', private=True)
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    ...
    No such operation: setPrivate

Removing branches
=================

Branches may have dependencies so it may not necessarily be possible to
delete them.

    >>> deletable = webservice.named_get('/~eric/fooix/feature-branch',
    ...                                  'canBeDeleted').jsonBody()
    >>> print deletable
    False

    Deleting only works on branches that do not have anything else
    depending on them.

    >>> response = webservice.delete('/~eric/fooix/feature-branch')
    >>> print response
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    ...

    >>> response = webservice.delete('/~mary/blob/bar')
    >>> print response
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    ...

    >>> print_branches(webservice, '/widgets')
    ~eric/fooix/trunk - Development
