To access /malone/assigned we have to be logged in.

  >>> print http(r"""
  ... GET /bugs/assigned HTTP/1.1
  ... """)
  HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
  ...
  Location: http://localhost/bugs/assigned/+login
  ...


When we're logged in as Foo Bar we can see our own bugs. Note that
/malone/assigned has been deprecated, in favour of the equivalent
report (at least by intent, if not by design) in FOAF.
