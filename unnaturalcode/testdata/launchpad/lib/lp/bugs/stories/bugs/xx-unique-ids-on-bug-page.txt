= Inline Editing of BugTasks =

On the bug page, the bugtasks are editable inline. This means that
basically the same form is included on the page for each bugtask. Even
so, if a bug has more than one bugtasks, all the ids used in the forms
are unique (except.for the "E-mail me about changes to this bug report"
option).

For example, bug one has more than one Package field.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/bugs/1')
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Package')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AmbiguityError: label 'Package'

Still, the ids of the fields are unique.

    >>> soup = find_main_content(user_browser.contents)
    >>> non_unique_ids = []
    >>> found_ids = set()
    >>> import re
    >>> for tag in soup.findAll(id=re.compile('.+')):
    ...    if tag['id'] in found_ids:
    ...        non_unique_ids.append(tag['id'])
    ...    found_ids.add(tag['id'])

(The "E-mail me..." option has the same id everywhere since the
user is not subscribing to the bugtask, but to the bug.)

    >>> non_unique_ids
    [u'subscribe', u'subscribe']
