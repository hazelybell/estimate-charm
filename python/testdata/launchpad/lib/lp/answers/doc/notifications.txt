Answer Tracker Email Notifications
==================================

When a question is created or changed, an email notification is sent
out, informing the subscribers and the answer contacts about the change.
Let's start with creating a question, and see what the resulting
notification looks like:

    >>> from zope.event import notify
    >>> from lp.answers.tests.test_question_notifications import (
    ...     pop_questionemailjobs)
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import IDistributionSet
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> sample_person = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName('ubuntu')
    >>> ubuntu_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, "Can't install Ubuntu",
    ...    "I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM drive, but it won't boot.")

The notifications get sent to the question's subscribers, the question's
target answer contacts as well as to the question's assignee. Initially,
only the submitter, Sample Person, is subscribed to the question and
there is no answer contact registered on Ubuntu, so only 1 notification
is sent:

    >>> ubuntu.answer_contacts
    []

    >>> [sub.person.displayname for sub in ubuntu_question.subscriptions]
    [u'Sample Person']

    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()
    >>> len(notifications)
    1

Note that the From address uses the submitter's name with the question's
email address. Answer's uses real names to help the questioner and the
answerers communicate. The Reply-To address is the question's address.
When using the mail client's reply feature, the user should clearly see
that he is replying to the question and not the user. [sic] Kiko and
Danilo have a story worth telling.

    >>> add_notification = notifications[0]

    >>> print add_notification.subject
    [Question #...]: Can't install Ubuntu

Like all Launchpad notifications should, the message contain in the
footer the reason why the user is receiving the notification.

    >>> print add_notification.body
    New question #... on Ubuntu:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
    I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM drive, but it won't boot.

The notification also includes a 'X-Launchpad-Question' header that
contains information about the question.

    >>> print add_notification.headers['X-Launchpad-Question']
    distribution=ubuntu; sourcepackage=None; status=Open;
    assignee=None; priority=Normal; language=en

Register the Ubuntu Team as Ubuntu's answer contact, so that they get
notified about the changes as well:

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> from lp.services.worlddata.interfaces.language import ILanguageSet
    >>> ubuntu_team = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> ubuntu_team.addLanguage(getUtility(ILanguageSet)['en'])
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(ubuntu_team, ubuntu_team.teamowner)
    True

And assign this question to Foo Bar, so that he will also receive
notifications:

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu_question.assignee = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user


Edit Notifications
------------------

If we edit the title and description of the question, a notification
will be sent.

    >>> from zope.interface import providedBy
    >>> from lazr.lifecycle.event import ObjectModifiedEvent
    >>> from lazr.lifecycle.snapshot import Snapshot

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> no_priv = getUtility(ILaunchBag).user
    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> ubuntu_question.title = "Installer doesn't work on a Mac"
    >>> ubuntu_question.description = """I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM
    ... drive, but it won't boot.
    ...
    ... It boots straight into MacOS 9."""
    >>> libstdcplusplus_sourcepackage = ubuntu.getSourcePackage('libstdc++')
    >>> ubuntu_question.target = libstdcplusplus_sourcepackage
    >>> notify(ObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question,
    ...     ['title', 'description', 'target']))

Three copies of the notification got sent, one to Sample Person, one to
Foo Bar, and one to Ubuntu Team:

    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()
    >>> edit_notification = notifications[1]
    >>> print edit_notification.subject
    Re: [Question #...]: Installer doesn't work on a Mac

    >>> print edit_notification.body
    Question #... libstdc++ in Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+source/libstdc++/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Project: Ubuntu => libstdc++ in Ubuntu
    <BLANKLINE>
    Summary changed to:
    Installer doesn't work on a Mac
    <BLANKLINE>
    Description changed to:
    I insert the install CD in the CD-ROM
    drive, but it won't boot.
    <BLANKLINE>
    It boots straight into MacOS 9.

# XXX flacoste 2006-09-19: Add checks for notification of change to #
status whiteboard, priority. For example, if a question is # transferred
to another QuestionTarget and priority is changed, # the notification
does not include priority.

    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> ubuntu_question.target = ubuntu
    >>> notify(ObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['target']))
    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()
    >>> edit_notification = notifications[1]
    >>> print edit_notification.body
    Question #... Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Project: libstdc++ in Ubuntu => Ubuntu

Changing the assignee will trigger a notification.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> ubuntu_question.assignee = no_priv
    >>> notify(ObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['assignee']))
    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()
    >>> edit_notification = notifications[1]
    >>> print edit_notification.body
    Question #... Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Assignee: Foo Bar => No Privileges Person

If we trigger a modification event when no changes worth notifying about
was made, no notification is sent:

    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> notify(ObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['status']))

    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()
    >>> len(notifications)
    0

After receiving that notification, Foo Bar unassigned himself:

    >>> ubuntu_question.assignee = None


Bug Linking and Unlinking Notifications
---------------------------------------


Bug link Notification
.....................

If we create a bug from the question, it will be reported as a bug that
has been linked to it:

    >>> from lp.bugs.interfaces.bug import CreateBugParams

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(
    ...     ubuntu_question, providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> params = CreateBugParams(
    ...     owner=no_priv, title="Installer fails on a Mac PPC",
    ...     comment=ubuntu_question.description)
    >>> bug = ubuntu_question.target.createBug(params)
    >>> ubuntu_question.linkBug(bug)
    <QuestionBug...>

    >>> notify(ObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['bugs']))

    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()
    >>> len(notifications)
    2

    >>> edit_notification = notifications[1]
    >>> print edit_notification.body
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Linked to bug: #...
        http://.../bugs/...
        "Installer fails on a Mac PPC"


Bug Unlinked Notification
.........................

A notification is also sent when a bug is unlinked from the question:

    >>> unmodified_question = Snapshot(ubuntu_question,
    ...     providing=providedBy(ubuntu_question))
    >>> ubuntu_question.unlinkBug(bug)
    <QuestionBug...>

    >>> notify(ObjectModifiedEvent(
    ...     ubuntu_question, unmodified_question, ['bugs']))

    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()
    >>> len(notifications)
    2

    >>> edit_notification = notifications[1]
    >>> print edit_notification.body
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Removed link to bug: #...
        http://.../bugs/...
        "Installer fails on a Mac PPC"


Linked Bug Status Changed Notification
......................................

When a question is linked to a bug, the question's subscribers are
notified of changes of the bug status. See answer-tracker-notifications-
linked-bug.txt for more information.


Workflow Notifications
----------------------

Notifications are also sent when workflow actions are done on questions.
The content of the notification will be different depending on the
workflow action done.

    >>> request_message = ubuntu_question.requestInfo(
    ...     no_priv, "What is your Mac model?")

    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()
    >>> support_notification = notifications[1]
    >>> print support_notification.subject
    Re: [Question #...]: Installer doesn't work on a Mac

For workflow notifications, the content of the notification is slightly
different based on whether you are the question owner or somebody else.

For example, the notification to the answer contacts and every other
subscribers except the question owner will look like this:

    >>> print support_notification.body
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Open => Needs information
    <BLANKLINE>
    No Privileges Person requested more information:
    What is your Mac model?

But the owner notification has a slightly different preamble and has an
extra footer.

    >>> print notifications[0].body
    Your question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Open => Needs information
    <BLANKLINE>
    No Privileges Person requested more information:
    What is your Mac model?
    <BLANKLINE>
    --...
    To answer this request for more information, you can either reply to
    this email or enter your reply at the following page:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...

Of course, if the owner unsubscribe from the question, he won't receives
a notification.

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> ubuntu_question.unsubscribe(sample_person, sample_person)
    >>> message = ubuntu_question.giveInfo('A PowerMac 7200.')

    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()
    >>> print notifications[1].body
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Needs information => Open
    <BLANKLINE>
    Sample Person gave more information on the question:
    A PowerMac 7200.

The notification for new messages on the question contain a 'References'
header to the previous message for threading purpose.

    >>> references = notifications[0].headers['References']
    >>> print references
    <...>

    >>> references == ubuntu_question.messages[-2].rfc822msgid
    True

We already saw the notifications sent for the requestInfo() and
giveInfo() transitions, let's see the other ones.

    # Subscribe the owner back, to compare the different notifications
    # sent.

    >>> ubuntu_question.subscribe(sample_person)
    <QuestionSubscription ...>


Notifications for expireQuestion()
..................................

    >>> login('no-priv@canonical.com')
    >>> message = ubuntu_question.expireQuestion(
    ...     no_priv, "Expired because of no recent activity.")
    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()

Default notification when the question is expired:

    >>> print notifications[1].body
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Open => Expired
    <BLANKLINE>
    No Privileges Person expired the question:
    Expired because of no recent activity.
    <BLANKLINE>

Notification received by the owner:

    >>> print notifications[0].body
    Your question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Open => Expired
    <BLANKLINE>
    No Privileges Person expired the question:
    Expired because of no recent activity.
    <BLANKLINE>
    --...
    If you're still having this problem, you can reopen your question either
    by replying to this email or by going to the following page and
    entering more information about your problem:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...


Notifications for reopen()
..........................

(This example will also show that comments are wrapped for 72 columns
display.)

    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> from lp.services.messages.interfaces.message import IMessageSet
    >>> email_msg = getUtility(IMessageSet).fromText(
    ...     subject=(
    ...         "Re: [Question %d]: Installer doesn't work on "
    ...         "a Mac" % ubuntu_question.id),
    ...     content=(
    ...         "I really need some help. I tried googling a bit but didn't "
    ...         "find anything useful.\n\nPlease provide some help to a "
    ...         "newbie."),
    ...     owner=sample_person)
    >>> message = ubuntu_question.reopen(email_msg)
    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()

Notice also how the 'Re' handling is handled nicely:

    >>> print notifications[0].subject
    Re: [Question #...]: Installer doesn't work on a Mac

Default notification when the owner reopens the question:

    >>> print notifications[1].body
    Question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Expired => Open
    <BLANKLINE>
    Sample Person is still having a problem:
    I really need some help. I tried googling a bit but didn't find anything
    useful.
    <BLANKLINE>
    Please provide some help to a newbie.

Notification received by the owner:

    >>> print notifications[0].body
    Your question #... on Ubuntu changed:
    http://.../ubuntu/+question/...
    <BLANKLINE>
        Status: Expired => Open
    <BLANKLINE>

    --...


Notifications for convertToQuestion()
-------------------------------------

Answer contacts and the bug owner is notified when questions are created
from bugs just like when a question is normally created.

    >>> bug_question = ubuntu.createQuestionFromBug(bug)
    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()
    >>> len(notifications)
    3


Notifications and Localized Questions
-------------------------------------

In general, only subscribers speaking the language of the question will
receive notifications related to it.

    # Register salgado as answer contact, this makes the pt_BR language
    # supported in Ubuntu.

    >>> salgado = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByName('salgado')
    >>> ubuntu.addAnswerContact(salgado, salgado)
    True

    >>> sorted([lang.code for lang in ubuntu.getSupportedLanguages()])
    [u'en', u'pt_BR']

    >>> from lp.services.worlddata.interfaces.language import ILanguageSet
    >>> login('test@canonical.com')
    >>> pt_BR_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, title=(
    ...     u"Abrir uma p\xe1gina que requer java quebra o firefox"),
    ...     description=(
    ...         u'Eu uso Ubuntu em um AMD64 e instalei o plugin java '
    ...         u'blackdown. O plugin \xe9 exibido em about:plugins e '
    ...         u'quando eu abro a pagina '
    ...         u'http://java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml, ela carrega '
    ...         u'corretamente e mostra a minha versao do java. No entanto, '
    ...         u'mover o mouse na pagina faz com que o firefox quebre.'),
    ...     language=getUtility(ILanguageSet)['pt_BR'])
    >>> notifications = pop_questionemailjobs()

    >>> print notifications[0].subject.encode('ASCII', 'backslashreplace')
    [Question #...]: Abrir uma p\xe1gina que requer java quebra o firefox

Similarly, when a question in a non-English language is modified or its
status changed, only the subscribers speaking that language will receive
the notifications.

    >>> pt_BR_question.giveInfo(
    ...     "Veja o screenshot: http://tinyurl.com/y8jq8z")
    <QuestionMessage...>

    >>> ignore = pop_questionemailjobs()

The exception to these general rules is that when a question is created
in language spoken by none of the answer contacts, each one will receive
an email notifying them that a question was posted in an unsupported
language.

For example, the French language is not spoken by any Ubuntu answer
contacts. So after posting a question in French, a notification will be
sent to the support list about that question:

    >>> french = getUtility(ILanguageSet)['fr']
    >>> french_question = ubuntu.newQuestion(
    ...     sample_person, title="Impossible d'installer Ubuntu",
    ...     description=u"Le CD ne semble pas fonctionn\xe9.",
    ...     language=french)
