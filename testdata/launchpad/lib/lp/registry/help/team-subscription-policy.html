    <h1>Team membership policy</h1>

    <p>
      There are four kinds of policy that describe who can be a member and
      how new memberships are handled. The choice of policy reflects the need
      to build a community versus the need to control Launchpad assets.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Open</dt>
      <dd>
        Membership is open, no approval required, and subteams can be open or
        closed. Any user can be a member of the team and no approval is
        required. Subteams can be Open, Delegated, Moderated, or Restricted.
        Open is a good choice for encouraging a community of contributors.
        Open teams cannot have PPAs.
      </dd>

      <dt>Delegated</dt>
      <dd>
        Membership is open, requires approval, and subteams can be open or
        closed. Any user can be a member of the team via a subteam, but team
        administrators approve direct memberships. Subteams can be Open,
        Delegated, Moderated, or Restricted. Delegated is a good choice for
        managing a large community of contributors. Delegated teams cannot
        have PPAs.
      </dd>

      <dt>Moderated</dt>
      <dd>
        Membership is closed, requires approval, and subteams must be closed.
        Any user can propose a new member, but team administrators approve
        membership. Subteams must be Moderated or Restricted. Moderated is a
        good choice for teams that manage things that need to be secure, like
        projects, branches, or PPAs, but want to encourage users to help.
      </dd>

      <dt>Restricted</dt>
      <dd>
        Membership is closed, requires approval, and subteams must be closed.
        Only the team's administrators can invite a user to be a member.
        Subteams must be Moderated or Restricted. Restricted is a good choice
        for teams that manage things that need to be secure, like projects,
        branches, or PPAs.
