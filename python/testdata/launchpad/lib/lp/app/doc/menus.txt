Menus
=====

Launchpad uses menus associated with content object views and facets (a
layer associate with a vhost). The FacetMenu and NavigationMenu are the
base classes for constructing menus to browse a content object and its
views.


Menu prerequisite objects and configuration
-------------------------------------------

We require a considerable amount of setup to construct menus and observe
their behaviour. At a minimum, we need interfaces, content objects, and
views to be registered before implementing menus.


Content objects that have menus
...............................

Menus are retrieved through adaption.  Here are two example interfaces;
later, implementations having facets and menus will be defined.

    >>> from zope.interface import Interface

    >>> class ICookbook(Interface):
    ...     """An object with facets and menus."""

    >>> class IRecipe(Interface):
    ...     """An object with facets and menus."""

    # Create a fake module that we'll patch our examples into.

    >>> import new
    >>> import sys
    >>> cookingexample = new.module('cookingexample')
    >>> sys.modules['lp.app.cookingexample'] = cookingexample

    >>> cookingexample.ICookbook = ICookbook
    >>> cookingexample.IRecipe = IRecipe

And here are simple content objects that implement the two interfaces.
They are derived from a base class that provides the required behaviours
for traversable objects.

    >>> from zope.interface import implements
    >>> from lp.services.webapp.interfaces import ICanonicalUrlData

    >>> class BaseContent:
    ...     implements(ICanonicalUrlData)
    ...
    ...     def __init__(self, name, parent):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...         self.path = name
    ...         self.inside = parent
    ...         self.rootsite = None

    >>> class Root(BaseContent):
    ...     """The root of 'cookery', a vhost and facet."""

    >>> class Cookbook(BaseContent):
    ...     implements(ICookbook)

    >>> class Recipe(BaseContent):
    ...     implements(IRecipe)


Content views associates with menus
...................................

The content object is discovered by traversing the URL hierarchy. Here
is a three objects hierarchy: (the root)/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam. Each
object has a canonical url derived from its place in the hierarchy.

    # Menu testing requires a request object that provides the traversed
    # objects. This function does most of the work, but views must be
    # assigned to the _last_obj_traversed attribute.

    >>> from lp.services.webapp import canonical_url
    >>> from lp.testing.menu import make_fake_request

    >>> root = Root('', None)
    >>> cookbook = Cookbook('joy-of-cooking', root)
    >>> recipe = Recipe('fried-spam', cookbook)

    >>> request = make_fake_request(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam',
    ...     traversed_objects=[cookbook, recipe])

    >>> canonical_url(cookbook)
    u'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking'

    >>> canonical_url(recipe)
    u'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam'

Content objects are not suitable for presentation by themselves; they
require a view class to adapt them to the required format. An object may
have many views, each delegated to one aspect of the object.

Navigation menus are used to connect the views into pseudo-hierarchy
from the last traversed content object. Some views implement a marker
interface to associate themselves with a specific sub menu below a
content object's menu.

    >>> from lp.services.webapp import LaunchpadView

    >>> class IRecipeEditMenuMarker(Interface):
    ...     """A marker interface of the RecipeEditMenu."""

    >>> class IRecipeJournalMenuMarker(Interface):
    ...     """A marker interface of the RecipeJournalMenu."""

    >>> class RecipeIndexView(LaunchpadView):
    ...     """View for summary of a recipe on the cookery facet."""

    >>> class RecipeEditInstructionsView(LaunchpadView):
    ...     """View for editing recipe instructions on the cookery facet."""
    ...     implements(IRecipeEditMenuMarker)

    >>> class RecipeEditIngredientsView(LaunchpadView):
    ...     """View for editing recipe ingedients on the cookery facet."""
    ...     implements(IRecipeEditMenuMarker)

    >>> class RecipeReadJournalView(LaunchpadView):
    ...     """View for reading a recipe's journal on the cookery facet."""
    ...     implements(IRecipeJournalMenuMarker)

    >>> class RecipeQuestionsAllView(LaunchpadView):
    ...     """View for all questions of a recipe on the questions facet."""

    # Monkey patch the interfaces and views into the cookingexample module.

    >>> cookingexample.IRecipeEditMenuMarker = IRecipeEditMenuMarker
    >>> cookingexample.IRecipeJournalMenuMarker = IRecipeJournalMenuMarker
    >>> cookingexample.RecipeIndexView = RecipeIndexView
    >>> cookingexample.RecipeEditInstructionsView = RecipeEditInstructionsView
    >>> cookingexample.RecipeEditIngredientsView = RecipeEditIngredientsView
    >>> cookingexample.RecipeReadJournalView = RecipeReadJournalView
    >>> cookingexample.RecipeQuestionsAllView = RecipeQuestionsAllView

The views for IRecipe are registered using ZCML. Each page requires a:

    * name: To get the view by name (the page)
    * for: The interface being adapted (IRecipe)
    * class: The class the adapter returns (the view)
    * permission: The required permission the Principle must possess
    * facet: Assign the page to a facet.
Views, FacetMenus, and NavigationMenus only interact with each other if
they are assigned to the same facet.

    >>> from zope.configuration import xmlconfig

    >>> zcmlcontext = xmlconfig.string("""

The FacetMenu class
-------------------

A FacetMenu is a menu that defines all the facets for a site. A facet
may be considered an application or focus. There may be many ways in
which a site's content object may be used. For example: one aspect of a
content object is its definition and publication, another might be
questions and answers about the content object.

FacetMenus are meant to be used as a base-class for writing your own
IFacetMenu classes.  An error is raise if it is directly called.

    >>> from lp.services.webapp import FacetMenu

    >>> bad_idea_menu = FacetMenu(object())
    >>> for link in bad_idea_menu.iterlinks():
    ...     pass
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Subclasses of FacetMenu must provide self.links

Here is the common FacetMenu for the cookery site. The FacetMenu class
has four attributes: usedfor, links, defaultlink, and enable_only. The
'usedfor' attribute associates the menu with a specific interface. The
required 'links' attribute is a list of the method names that return
links. The 'defaultlink' attribute defines the selected link when the
facet is not known for the context being viewed. The enable_links
attribute is a list of links that are enabled; a subset of links that
are appropriate for a context object.

    >>> from lp.services.webapp import Link

    >>> class CookeryFacetMenu(FacetMenu):
    ...
    ...     usedfor = ICookbook
    ...     links = ['summary', 'questions', 'variations']
    ...     defaultlink = 'summary'
    ...     enable_only = ['summary', 'questions']
    ...
    ...     def summary(self):
    ...         target = ''
    ...         text = 'Summary'
    ...         summary = 'Summary of %s in Cookery' % self.context.name
    ...         return Link(target, text, summary)
    ...
    ...     def questions(self):
    ...         target = '+questions'
    ...         text = 'Questions'
    ...         summary = 'Questions and answers about %s' % self.context.name
    ...         return Link(target, text, summary)
    ...
    ...     def variations(self):
    ...         target = '+variations'
    ...         text = 'Variations'
    ...         summary = 'recipe variations for %s' % self.context.name
    ...         return Link(target, text, summary)

    >>> cookingexample.CookeryFacetMenu = CookeryFacetMenu

An instance of a FacetMenu is usually retrieved through adaption, but we
can directly create one with a context object to show that its methods
can access `self.context`.

    >>> from zope.component import provideAdapter
    >>> from zope.security.checker import (
    ...     defineChecker, InterfaceChecker, NamesChecker)
    >>> from lp.services.webapp.interfaces import (
    ...     IFacetLink, ILink, ILinkData)
    >>> from lp.services.webapp.menu import (
    ...     FacetLink, MenuLink)
    >>> from lazr.uri import URI

    # The adapters for the link types used by menus are registered in ZCML.
    # That is not the focus of this test so they are manually registered.

    >>> provideAdapter(MenuLink, [ILinkData], ILink)
    >>> provideAdapter(FacetLink, [ILinkData], IFacetLink)
    >>> defineChecker(FacetLink, InterfaceChecker(IFacetLink))
    >>> defineChecker(MenuLink, InterfaceChecker(ILink))
    >>> defineChecker(URI, NamesChecker(dir(URI)))

    >>> from lazr.restful.utils import safe_hasattr
    >>> def summarise_links(menu, url=None, facet=None):
    ...     """List the links and their attributes."""
    ...     if url is not None:
    ...         url = URI(url)
    ...     extra_arguments = {}
    ...     if facet is not None:
    ...         extra_arguments['selectedfacetname'] = facet
    ...     for link in menu.iterlinks(url, **extra_arguments):
    ...         print 'link %s' % link.name
    ...         attributes = ('url', 'enabled', 'menu', 'selected', 'linked')
    ...         for attrname in attributes:
    ...             if not safe_hasattr(link, attrname):
    ...                 continue
    ...             print '    %s: %s' % (attrname, getattr(link, attrname))

    >>> summarise_links(
    ...     CookeryFacetMenu(cookbook),
    ...     url='http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking',
    ...     facet=None)
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        selected: True
        linked: False
    link questions
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/+questions
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        selected: False
        linked: True
    link variations
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/+variations
        enabled: False
        menu: None
        selected: False
        linked: True

Note that the 'variations' link is not enabled. See the section `Enabled
and disabled links` for how this is done.


The NavigationMenu class
------------------------

Navigation menus are defined for content or view objects.  Each object
has just one navigation menu, and it is available at all times. A page
may display the content object's menu and the content object's view's
menu. The view's menu may be considered to be a sub menu because is may
be subordinate to the content object's menu.

NavigationMenu is a base class for writing your own INavigationMenu
implementations. It cannot be used directly.

    >>> from lp.services.webapp import NavigationMenu

    >>> bad_idea_menu = NavigationMenu(object())

    >>> for link in bad_idea_menu.iterlinks():
    ...     pass
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Subclasses of NavigationMenu must provide self.links

We will use three subclasses to demonstrate how navigation menus are
associated with content objects. Each menu defines a 'usedfor'
attribute, which tells the registration machinery how to render this
menu as an adapter. The sub menu is indirectly associated to the main
menu though one of its links.

    >>> class RecipeEditMenu(NavigationMenu):
    ...     usedfor = IRecipeEditMenuMarker
    ...     facet = 'cookery'
    ...     title = 'Edit'
    ...     links = ('edit_instructions', 'edit_ingredients')
    ...
    ...     def edit_instructions(self):
    ...         target = '+edit-instructions'
    ...         text = 'Edit instructions'
    ...         return Link(target, text)
    ...
    ...     def edit_ingredients(self):
    ...         target = '+edit-ingredients'
    ...         text = 'Edit ingredients'
    ...         return Link(target, text)

Menus can provide extra attributes that are available to the TAL
processing. These are defined by the attribute 'extra_attributes'.  When
the MenuAPI is processing the menu, each of these attributes is also
available in the generated dictionary.

    >>> class RecipeJournalMenu(NavigationMenu):
    ...     usedfor = IRecipeJournalMenuMarker
    ...     facet = 'cookery'
    ...     title = 'Journal'
    ...     links = ('read_journal', 'write_entry')
    ...     extra_attributes = ('journal_entries',)
    ...
    ...     @property
    ...     def journal_entries(self):
    ...         return 42
    ...
    ...     def read_journal(self):
    ...         target = '+read-journal'
    ...         text = 'Read Journal entries'
    ...         return Link(target, text)
    ...
    ...     def write_entry(self):
    ...         target = '+write-entry'
    ...         text = 'Write a journal entry'
    ...         return Link(target, text)

    >>> class RecipeMenu(NavigationMenu):
    ...     usedfor = IRecipe
    ...     facet = 'cookery'
    ...     links = ('summary', 'journal')
    ...
    ...     def summary(self):
    ...         target = ''
    ...         text = 'Summary'
    ...         return Link(target, text, menu=IRecipeEditMenuMarker)
    ...
    ...     def journal(self):
    ...         target = '+journal'
    ...         text = 'Journal'
    ...         return Link(target, text, menu=IRecipeJournalMenuMarker)

    >>> class RecipeQuestionsMenu(NavigationMenu):
    ...     usedfor = IRecipe
    ...     facet = 'questions'
    ...     links = ('all_questions', 'answered')
    ...
    ...     def all_questions(self):
    ...         target = '+questions?filter=all'
    ...         text = 'All'
    ...         return Link(target, text)
    ...
    ...     def answered(self):
    ...         target = '+questions?filter=answered'
    ...         text = 'Answered'
    ...         return Link(target, text)

    # Monkey patch the menus into the cookingexample module.

    >>> cookingexample.RecipeEditMenu = RecipeEditMenu
    >>> cookingexample.RecipeJournalMenu = RecipeJournalMenu
    >>> cookingexample.RecipeMenu = RecipeMenu
    >>> cookingexample.RecipeQuestionsMenu = RecipeQuestionsMenu

Menus are normally created through adaption, but we can make an instance
of the RecipeMenu class to see the menu-related attributes of the links.
(NavigationMenu will work with an object or its view.) Each link's state
is defined in by the RecipeMenu class and the view of recipe.

    >>> summarise_links(
    ...     RecipeMenu(recipe),
    ...     url='http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam')
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeEditMenuMarker...>
        linked: False
    link journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+journal
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeJournalMenuMarker...>
        linked: True


Enabled and disabled links
--------------------------

Menus are often constructed by sub classing a common menu. The common
menu defines all the facet links, and the enabled link that are common
to most content objects.

The CookeryFacetMenu defines all the facets for the cookery site for all
content interfaces, three links: summary, questions, and variations. But
it only defined two enabled links: summary and questions.  The
variations link is not enabled because it only applies to recipes. (See
`The FacetMenu class`.)

The RecipeFacetMenu subclass defined below only applies to IRecipe
content object and it has all facet links enabled.

    >>> class RecipeFacetMenu(CookeryFacetMenu):
    ...
    ...     usedfor = IRecipe
    ...     enable_only = ['summary', 'questions', 'variations']

    # Monkey patch the menus into the cookingexample module.

    >>> cookingexample.RecipeFacetMenu = RecipeFacetMenu

    >>> summarise_links(
    ...     RecipeFacetMenu(recipe),
    ...     url='http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam',
    ...     facet=None)
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        selected: True
        linked: False
    link questions
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+questions
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        selected: False
        linked: True
    link variations
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+variations
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        selected: False
        linked: True


Menu requirements
-----------------

All menus descend from MenuBase which impose a number of requirements
upon its descendants.

The menu title is optional, but a good idea when used for tabs related
to a view that will be displayed in addition to the tabs related to the
context.

A menu must define a tuple of links that it manages. When the links are
not defined, or links is not of the right type, an error is raised.

    >>> class BogusMenu(NavigationMenu):
    ...     usedfor = IRecipe

    >>> summarise_links(BogusMenu(recipe))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    AssertionError: Subclasses of NavigationMenu must provide self.links

    >>> class BogusMenu(NavigationMenu):
    ...     usedfor = IRecipe
    ...     title = 'Bogus menu'
    ...     links = 'not a tuple'

    >>> summarise_links(BogusMenu(recipe))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    AssertionError: self.links must be a tuple or list.

An error is raised if a class enables a link that is not in the list of
links. CookeryFacetMenu did not include 'non_link' in its links, so an
error is raised when BogusFacetMenu is used.

    >>> class BogusFacetMenu(CookeryFacetMenu):
    ...
    ...     usedfor = IRecipe
    ...     enable_only = ['summary', 'non_link']

    >>> summarise_links(
    ...     BogusFacetMenu(recipe),
    ...     url='http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam',
    ...     facet=None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    AssertionError: Links in 'enable_only' not found in 'links': non_link

The iterlinks() method of menus requires a `IHTTPApplicationRequest` (a
request object) present in the `Interaction` to determine the state of
its links. Without a request, an error is raised.

    >>> from zope.security.management import endInteraction

    >>> endInteraction()
    >>> summarise_links(RecipeMenu(recipe))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'getURL'


Registering menus as adapters for content objects and views
-----------------------------------------------------------

The menus must be registered as an adapter for their respective classes.
Menus can be associated with content objects and or views. This is
normally performed in ZCML; without the ZCML registration, the cookery
objects cannot be adapted to menus.

    >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter, queryAdapter
    >>> from lp.services.webapp.interfaces import (
    ...     IFacetMenu, INavigationMenu)

    >>> request = make_fake_request(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam',
    ...     traversed_objects=[cookbook, recipe])
    >>> recipe_view = getMultiAdapter((recipe, request), name='+index')
    >>> request._last_obj_traversed = recipe_view
    >>> print queryAdapter(recipe_view, INavigationMenu)
    None

Once registered, the objects can be adapted. The RecipeFacetMenu can be
adapted from a Recipe. The RecipeMenu and RecipeQuestionsMenu
INavigationMenus can also be adapted from a Recipe by including the
facet name.

    >>> zcmlcontext = xmlconfig.string("""
    ... <configure xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser">
    ...   <include file="lib/lp/services/webapp/meta.zcml" />
    ...   <browser:menus
    ...     module="lp.app.cookingexample"
    ...     classes="
    ...       CookeryFacetMenu RecipeFacetMenu
    ...       RecipeMenu RecipeEditMenu RecipeJournalMenu RecipeQuestionsMenu"
    ...     />
    ... </configure>
    ... """)

    >>> recipe_facetmenu = queryAdapter(
    ...     recipe, IFacetMenu)
    >>> recipe_facetmenu
    <RecipeFacetMenu ...>

    >>> recipe_navigationmenu = queryAdapter(
    ...     recipe, INavigationMenu, name='cookery')
    >>> recipe_navigationmenu
    <RecipeMenu ...>

    >>> recipe_questions_navigationmenu = queryAdapter(
    ...     recipe, INavigationMenu, name='questions')
    >>> recipe_questions_navigationmenu
    <RecipeQuestionsMenu ...>

And the RecipeEditMenu can be retrieved by adapting the recipe's view
+edit-ingredients.

    >>> recipe_ingredients_view = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (recipe, request), name='+edit-ingredients')
    >>> recipe_overview_menu = queryAdapter(
    ...     recipe_ingredients_view, INavigationMenu, name='cookery')
    >>> recipe_overview_menu
    <RecipeEditMenu ...>


Menu linked links
-----------------

A link is not linked (the anchor is not rendered) when its URL matches
the request URI; the user should not navigate to a page he is already
seeing. The matched URI comes from the view's request...

    >>> recipe_navigationmenu = queryAdapter(
    ...     recipe, INavigationMenu, name='cookery')
    >>> request.getURL()
    'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam'

    >>> summarise_links(recipe_navigationmenu)
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeEditMenuMarker...>
        linked: False
    link journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+journal
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeJournalMenuMarker...>
        linked: True

...or from the request_url keyword argument for iterlinks() that is
passed by the helper function.

    >>> summarise_links(
    ...     recipe_navigationmenu,
    ...     url='http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+journal')
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeEditMenuMarker...>
        linked: True
    link journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+journal
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeJournalMenuMarker...>
        linked: False

Note that query parameters are ignored when matching the URL.

    >>> summarise_links(
    ...     recipe_navigationmenu,
    ...     url='http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam?x=1')
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        ...
        linked: False
    link journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+journal
        ...
        linked: True

Although if the link contains query parameters, the URL must be an exact
prefix to be considered the current one.

    >>> summarise_links(
    ...     recipe_questions_navigationmenu,
    ...     url=('http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+questions'
    ...          '?filter=all&sort=Descending'))
    link all_questions
        url: http://.../joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+questions?filter=all
        ...
        linked: False
    link answered
        url: http://.../joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+questions?filter=answered
        ...
        linked: True

    >>> summarise_links(
    ...     recipe_questions_navigationmenu,
    ...     url=('http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+questions'
    ...          '?filter=Obsolete'))
    link all_questions
        url: http://.../joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+questions?filter=all
        ...
        linked: True
    link answered
        url: http://.../joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+questions?filter=answered
        ...
        linked: True

(Some menu subclasses have additional constraint on when the linked
attribute might be True.)


FacetMenu selected links
........................

Facet links are selected when their name matches the selectedfacetname.
The question link can be selected by passing 'question' as the
selectedfacetname. The selection is independent of whether the link is
linked, as can be seen when the url is not explicitly passed.

    >>> request.getURL()
    'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam'

    >>> summarise_links(
    ...     CookeryFacetMenu(cookbook),
    ...     facet='questions')
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        selected: False
        linked: True
    link questions
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/+questions
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        selected: True
        linked: True
    link variations
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/+variations
        enabled: False
        menu: None
        selected: False
        linked: True


NavigationMenu linked links
...........................

When navigational menus are associated with a content object and one of
its views, they provide a menu and sub menu. The view's sub menu belongs
to one of the content object's menu's links.

A link will be linked if request's url matches one of the links in the
link's menu. A link's menu contains child links in the navigational
hierarchy; when a child link is linked, the parent link is not linked
itself. (It is assume that one of the link in the child menu, will be
identical to the one in the parent's menu.)

    >>> request = make_fake_request(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev'
    ...     '/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+edit-ingredients',
    ...     traversed_objects=[cookbook, recipe])
    >>> recipe_ingredients_view = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (recipe, request), name='+edit-ingredients')
    >>> request._last_obj_traversed = recipe_ingredients_view

    >>> recipe_summary_menu = queryAdapter(
    ...     recipe, INavigationMenu, name='cookery')
    >>> summarise_links(recipe_summary_menu)
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeEditMenuMarker...>
        linked: False
    link journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+journal
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeJournalMenuMarker...>
        linked: True

    >>> recipe_overview_menu = queryAdapter(
    ...     recipe_ingredients_view, INavigationMenu, name='cookery')
    >>> summarise_links(recipe_overview_menu)
    link edit_instructions
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+edit-instructions
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        linked: True
    link edit_ingredients
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+edit-ingredients
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        linked: False

The link state changes when a url corresponding with a link in another
sub menu is viewed. Viewing the +read_journal view in the Journal sub
menu of the RecipeMenu will change the state of both menus.

    >>> request = make_fake_request(
    ...     'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+read-journal',
    ...     traversed_objects=[cookbook, recipe])
    >>> recipe_journal_view = getMultiAdapter(
    ...     (recipe, request), name='+read-journal')
    >>> request._last_obj_traversed = recipe_journal_view

    >>> summarise_links(recipe_summary_menu)
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeEditMenuMarker...>
        linked: True
    link journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+journal
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeJournalMenuMarker...>
        linked: False

    >>> summarise_links(
    ...     queryAdapter(
    ...         recipe_journal_view, INavigationMenu, name='cookery'))
    link read_journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+read-journal
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        linked: False
    link write_entry
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+write-entry
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        linked: True


Absolute links
..............

Absolute urls can be made with a full url, including the host part, or
as a url path beginning with '/'.

Sometimes the target will be within Launchpad. Other times, the link
will be to an external site.

When the link is to a page in Launchpad, we need to treat it the same as
a normal relative link.  That is, we need to compute 'linked' and
'selected' as for relative links. The usual use-case is computing an
absolute link to a page inside launchpad using canonical_url.  In this
case, the host and protocol part of the url will be the same for the
canonical_url as for the current request.  This is what we will use to
see if we have a link to a page within Launchpad.

    >>> class AbsoluteUrlTargetTestFacets(FacetMenu):
    ...     links = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'spoo']
    ...
    ...     def foo(self):
    ...         target = ''
    ...         text = 'Foo'
    ...         return Link(target, text)
    ...
    ...     def bar(self):
    ...         target = 'ftp://barlink.example.com/barbarbar'
    ...         text = 'External bar'
    ...         return Link(target, text)
    ...
    ...     def baz(self):
    ...         target = 'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/+baz'
    ...         text = 'Baz'
    ...         return Link(target, text)
    ...
    ...     def spoo(self):
    ...         target = '/joy-of-cooking/+spoo'
    ...         text = 'Spoo'
    ...         return Link(target, text)

    >>> print canonical_url(cookbook)
    http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking

    >>> request_url = URI('http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking')

    >>> facets = AbsoluteUrlTargetTestFacets(cookbook)
    >>> for link in facets.iterlinks(request_url):
    ...     print link.url, link.linked
    http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking False
    ftp://barlink.example.com/barbarbar True
    http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/+baz True
    http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/+spoo True


The current view's menu
.......................

The linked state of a link may be determined from the menu adapted from
the current view. The object responsible for rendering the page is the
last object in the request.traversed_objects list, but that object is
not always the view. It may be the view's instancemethod.

In the example above recipe_ingredients_view was appended to the
request.traversed_objects just as the publisher would do. If the
publisher were to append the view's __call__ method, the RecipeMenu will
still have the correct state because iterlinks() knows how to find the
instancemethods object.

    >>> request._last_obj_traversed = recipe_journal_view.__call__

    >>> summarise_links(recipe_summary_menu)
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeEditMenuMarker...>
        linked: True
    link journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+journal
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeJournalMenuMarker...>
        linked: False

    # Restore the _last_obj_traversed to the view that matches the
    # request's URL.

    >>> request._last_obj_traversed = recipe_journal_view


Accessing menus from TALES
--------------------------

Most of the interaction with menus happens in page templates. The TAL
namespace 'menu' is used to query the state of a menu and to iterate
over the links. The TALES takes the form of 'view/menu:navigation'.

    >>> from zope.interface import classImplements
    >>> from zope.traversing.adapters import DefaultTraversable
    >>> from zope.traversing.interfaces import IPathAdapter, ITraversable
    >>> from lp.testing.menu import summarise_tal_links
    >>> from lp.app.browser.tales import MenuAPI
    >>> from lp.testing import test_tales

    # MenuAPI is normally registered as an IPathAdapter in ZCML. This
    # approximates what is done by the code:

    >>> classImplements(MenuAPI, IPathAdapter)
    >>> provideAdapter(MenuAPI, [Interface,], IPathAdapter, name='menu')
    >>> provideAdapter(DefaultTraversable, (Interface,), ITraversable)

    >>> links_list = test_tales(
    ...     'context/menu:facet', context=recipe, request=request)
    >>> summarise_tal_links(links_list)
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        selected: True
        linked: True
    link questions
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+questions
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        selected: False
        linked: True
    link variations
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+variations
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        selected: False
        linked: True

    >>> links_dict = test_tales(
    ...     'context/menu:navigation', context=recipe, request=request)
    >>> summarise_tal_links(links_dict)
    link journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+journal
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeJournalMenuMarker...>
        linked: False
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeEditMenuMarker...>
        linked: True

    >>> links_dict = test_tales(
    ...     'context/menu:navigation', context=recipe_journal_view,
    ...     request=request)
    >>> summarise_tal_links(links_dict)
    attribute journal_entries: 42
    link read_journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+read-journal
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        linked: False
    link write_entry
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+write-entry
        enabled: True
        menu: None
        linked: True

The attributes of the menu can be accessed with the normal path method.

    >>> print test_tales('context/menu:navigation/journal_entries',
    ...     context=recipe_journal_view, request=request)
    42


Looking up the nearest navigation menu
--------------------------------------

Sometimes the view will have a navigation menu, but the view's context
will not.  In this case we want to search upwards through the navigation
hierarchy for a context that *does* have a navigation menu.

In this example we will use recipe comments.  The comment view has a
menu, but the comment object does not.  We want the call to
'context/menu:navigation' to return the navigation menu for the recipe
that the comment refers to.

    >>> class IComment(Interface):
    ...     """A comment on a recipe."""

    >>> class Comment(BaseContent):
    ...     implements(IComment)

    # This is usually done in ZCML by browser:defaultView.

    >>> from zope.publisher.interfaces import IDefaultViewName
    >>> from zope.publisher.interfaces.browser import IDefaultBrowserLayer
    >>> provideAdapter(
    ...     '+index',
    ...     [IComment, IDefaultBrowserLayer],
    ...     IDefaultViewName)

We'll simulate the user viewing a comment.

    >>> comment = Comment('a-comment', recipe)
    >>> print canonical_url(comment)
    http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/a-comment

When we try to look up the menu for the comment, the navigation menu for
the next highest object in the URL hierarchy, the Recipe, will be
returned.

    >>> links_dict = test_tales(
    ...     'context/menu:navigation', context=comment)
    >>> summarise_tal_links(links_dict)
    link journal
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+journal
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeJournalMenuMarker...>
        linked: False
    link summary
        url: http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam
        enabled: True
        menu: <...IRecipeEditMenuMarker...>
        linked: True


Menus for objects without canonical URLs or menus
.................................................

If we try a navigation menu lookup on an object without a canonical url
or a navigation menu adapter, then no menu will be returned, and no
error will be raised by the template.

    >>> class MenulessView(LaunchpadView):
    ...     # Needed so the IPathAdapter can be applied to this view.
    ...     implements(Interface)
    ...     __launchpad_facetname__ = 'cookery'

    >>> menuless_view = MenulessView(comment, request)

    >>> test_tales('view/menu:navigation', view=menuless_view)
    {}


Rendering the menu in a template
--------------------------------

Menus are often rendered with a view controller class to ensure that
only enabled links are rendered. The TALES expression might call the
view using:

    tal:content view/menu:navigation@@+navigationmenu

The view and template are usually registered in ZCML. The following is
an example of a template and view classes for the FacetMenu and
NavigationMenus used in the previous TALES section.

    >>> import operator
    >>> import tempfile
    >>> from z3c.ptcompat import ViewPageTemplateFile
    >>> from lp.services.webapp.menu import (
    ...     get_facet, get_current_view)

    >>> menu_fragement = """\
    ...  <div>
    ...    <label
    ...      tal:condition="view/title|nothing"
    ...      tal:content="view/title">Menu title</label>
    ...    <ul>
    ...      <li tal:repeat="link view/links">
    ...        <a
    ...          tal:condition="link/linked"
    ...          tal:define="selected link/selected|string:None"
    ...          tal:attributes="href link/url;
    ...                          class string:selected-${selected}"
    ...          tal:content="structure link/escapedtext">link text</a>
    ...        <strong
    ...          tal:condition="not: link/linked"
    ...          tal:content="structure link/escapedtext">text</strong>
    ...      </li>
    ...    </ul>
    ...  </div>"""
    >>> template_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()
    >>> template_file.write(menu_fragement)
    >>> template_file.flush()

    >>> class FacetMenuView(LaunchpadView):
    ...     template = ViewPageTemplateFile(template_file.name)
    ...     def initialize(self):
    ...         requested_view = get_current_view(self.request)
    ...         facet = get_facet(requested_view)
    ...         menu = self.getMenu(facet)
    ...         menu.request = self.request
    ...         self.links = sorted(
    ...             [link for link in menu.iterlinks() if link.enabled],
    ...             key=operator.attrgetter('sort_key'))
    ...
    ...     def getMenu(self, facet=None):
    ...         return queryAdapter(self.context, IFacetMenu)

    >>> class NavigationMenuView(FacetMenuView):
    ...     def getMenu(self, facet=None):
    ...         menu = queryAdapter(self.context, INavigationMenu, name=facet)
    ...         self.title = menu.title
    ...         return menu

    # NavigationMenuView is normally registered as an IPathAdapter in ZCML.
    # This approximates what is done by the code:

    >>> classImplements(FacetMenuView, IPathAdapter)
    >>> classImplements(NavigationMenuView, IPathAdapter)

The Summary in the facet menu is selected because the current facet is
'cookery'.

    >>> recipe_facet_menu_view = FacetMenuView(recipe, request)
    >>> recipe_facet_menu_view.initialize()
    >>> print recipe_facet_menu_view()
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href=".../joy-of-cooking/fried-spam"
             class="selected-True">Summary</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=".../joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+questions"
             class="selected-False">Questions</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=".../joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+variations"
             class="selected-False">Variations</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

The Journal link is selected because the Journal sub menu is also
available (as can be seen in the next example).

    >>> recipe_menu_view = NavigationMenuView(recipe, request)
    >>> recipe_menu_view.initialize()
    >>> print recipe_menu_view()
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href=".../joy-of-cooking/fried-spam"
             class="selected-None">Summary</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Journal</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

The Read Journal entries link is selected because that is the current
URL.

    >>> request.getURL()
    'http://launchpad.dev/joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+read-journal'

    >>> recipe_view_menu_view = NavigationMenuView(
    ...     recipe_journal_view, request)
    >>> recipe_view_menu_view.initialize()
    >>> print recipe_view_menu_view()
    <div>
      <label>Journal</label>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Read Journal entries</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href=".../joy-of-cooking/fried-spam/+write-entry"
             class="selected-None">Write
            a journal entry</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    # Remove the temporary file.

    >>> template_file.close()


tearDown
--------

Restore the modules module to its starting state. First remove the ZCML
registrations. Then, in dict order, remove the cooking example by
setting private names, then public names (except for __builtins__) to
None. See `http://www.python.org/doc/essays/cleanup/` steps C1-3.

    >>> from zope.testing.cleanup import cleanUp
    >>> cleanUp()

    >>> for key in sys.modules[cooking_module].__dict__:
    ...     if key.startswith('_') and not key.startswith('__'):
    ...         sys.modules[cooking_module].__dict__[key] = None
    >>> for key in sys.modules[cooking_module].__dict__:
    ...     if key != '__builtins__':
    ...         sys.modules[cooking_module].__dict__[key] = None
    >>> sys.modules[cooking_module] = None
    >>> del sys.modules['lp.app.cookingexample']
