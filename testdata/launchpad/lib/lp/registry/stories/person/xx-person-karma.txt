Karma
=====

Launchpad assigns a person karma for performing actions beneficial to
the community.  A person's current total karma is available on their
profile page.

    >>> anon_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/~name12')
    >>> print anon_browser.title
    Sample Person in Launchpad

    >>> content = find_main_content(anon_browser.contents)
    >>> karma = find_tag_by_id(content, 'karma-total')
    >>> print karma.renderContents()
    138

The total karma points is also a link to the person's karma summary page.

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('138').click()
    >>> print anon_browser.title
