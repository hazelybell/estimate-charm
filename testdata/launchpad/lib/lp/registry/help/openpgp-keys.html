    <h1>Introducing OpenPGP keys</h1>

    <p>
      An OpenPGP (also called GnuPrivacyGuard) key allows you to sign documents, such as emails or text files, using a digital key.
    </p>

    <p>There are two parts to an OpenPGP key: one public that you share with the world and the other private,
       which you should guard closely. Both are standard text files that make up a digital signature.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Launchpad, you can use your OpenPGP key to identify yourself when using the bug
      tracker's email interface, when uploading distribution packages and when signing a code
      of conduct.
    </p>

    <h2>Generating your key in Ubuntu</h2>

    <p>
      The easiest way to generate a new OpenPGP key in Ubuntu is to use the
      <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em> tool. If you are using Ubuntu
      10.04 or an earlier version, it is located at
      <em>Applications &gt; Accessories &gt; Passwords and Encryption Keys</em>.
      In Ubuntu 10.10 and later versions, it is located at
      <em>System &gt; Preferences &gt; Passwords and Encryption Keys</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1</strong> open <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2</strong> Select <em>File &gt; New</em>, select <em>PGP Key</em> and then follow the on-screen instructions.
    </p>

    <p>Now you'll see your new key listed in the
      <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em> tool.
    </p>

    <h2>Publishing your key</h2>

    <p>Your key is useful only if other people can verify items that you sign. By publishing your key to a keyserver, which acts as a directory of people's public keys, you can make your public key available to anyone else.</p>

    <p>Before you add your key to Launchpad, you need to push it to the Ubuntu keyserver.</p>

    <h3>Using <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em></h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1</strong> Open <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2</strong> Select the <em>My Personal Keys</em> tab,
      select your key.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3</strong> Select <em>Remote &gt; Sync and Publish Keys</em>
      from the menu. Choose the <em>Sync</em> button. (You may need to add
      hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com to your key servers if you are not
      using Ubuntu.)
    </p>

    <p>
      It can take up to thirty minutes before your key is available to
      Launchpad. After that time, you're ready to
      <a href="/+help-registry/import-pgp-key.html">import your new key into
      Launchpad</a>!
    </p>

    <h2>Renewing your key</h2>

    <p>
      You may have set your key to expire. You can update your key and
      republish it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 1</strong> Open <em>Passwords and Encryption Keys</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2</strong> Select the <em>My Personal Keys</em> tab,
      select your key, and open the property window by pressing Space Bar
      our double clicking with your pointer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3</strong> Set a new expiration date or choose never.
    </p>

    <p>
      See the <em>Publishing your key</em> section above.
