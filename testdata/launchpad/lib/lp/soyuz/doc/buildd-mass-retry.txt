Buildd-mass-retry behaviour
===========================

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> import os
    >>> import sys
    >>> from lp.services.config import config

'buildd-mass-retry' is a tool designed to retry a group of 'failed'
build records in a distroseries and/or architecture.

    >>> script = os.path.join(
    ...     config.root, "scripts", "ftpmaster-tools", "buildd-mass-retry.py")

The user can specify a distribution, a suite name (-s) and/or and
architecture (-a) as a build record provider, it will restrict the
target group.

Also, can combine the types of failure we allow to be retried:

 * -F: retry builds marked as FAILEDTOBUILD
 * -D: retry builds marked as MANUALDEPWAIT
 * -C: retry builds marked as CHROOTWAIT

The available types can be combined acording the situation.

The script provides dry-run mode (-N).

See binarypackagebuild.txt for more information about IBuild.retry().

Passing only suite, request retry on all failed states:

    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     [sys.executable, script, "-v", "-NFDC", "-s", "hoary"],
    ...     stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    >>> process.returncode
    0
    >>> print stderr
    INFO    Creating lockfile: ...
    INFO    Initializing Build Mass-Retry for
    'The Hoary Hedgehog Release/RELEASE'
    INFO    Processing builds in 'Failed to build'
    INFO    Processing builds in 'Dependency wait'

    INFO    Processing builds in 'Chroot problem'
    INFO    Success.
    INFO    Dry-run.

Superseded builds won't be retried; buildd-manager will just skip the build
and set it to SUPERSEDED.

    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.binarypackagebuild import (
    ...     IBinaryPackageBuildSet)
    >>> from lp.soyuz.enums import PackagePublishingStatus
    >>> build = getUtility(IBinaryPackageBuildSet).getByID(12)
    >>> pub = removeSecurityProxy(build.current_source_publication)

Let's mark the build from the previous run superseded.

    >>> pub.status = PackagePublishingStatus.SUPERSEDED
    >>> print build.current_source_publication
    None
    >>> transaction.commit()

A new run doesn't pick it up.

    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     [sys.executable, script, "-v", "-NFDC", "-s", "hoary"],
    ...     stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    >>> process.returncode
    0
    >>> print stderr

    >>> pub.status = PackagePublishingStatus.PUBLISHED
    >>> transaction.commit()

Passing an architecture, which contains no failed build records,
nothing is done:

    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     [
    ...         sys.executable, script,
    ...         "-v", "-NFDC", "-s", "hoary", "-a", "hppa",
    ...     ],
    ...     stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    >>> process.returncode
    0
    >>> print stderr
    INFO    Creating lockfile: ...

Selecting only a specific failed state:

    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     [sys.executable, script, "-v", "-NF", "-s", "hoary"],
    ...     stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    >>> process.returncode
    0
    >>> print stderr
