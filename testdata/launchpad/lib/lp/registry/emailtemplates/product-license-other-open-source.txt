Hello %(user_displayname)s,

You recently stated that the project '%(product_name)s'
in Launchpad has an 'Other/Open Source' licence.

Sometimes new projects are licensed as 'Other/Open Source' because the
licensing decisions have not yet been made.  If that is the case for
your project, it's important that you update the licensing in Launchpad
as soon as a licensing decision has been made.

If you need to change the licence for your project you can do this
by following the 'Change Details' link on your project's
overview page.

Launchpad is a collaboration site, free to use for projects with an
approved open source licence. When you registered your project, you'd
have seen a list of licences presented. These are the licences we
automatically recognise.

If you have a different licence to one on the approved list, it must
follow the guidelines we list on the following page in order to be
approved: https://help.launchpad.net/Legal/ProjectLicensing

Further information is on our FAQ "Can closed-source or proprietary
projects use Launchpad?"
The link is here: https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+faq/208

If your project's licensing does not meet the guidelines, it will be
marked "Proprietary". Proprietary projects can use Launchpad by
purchasing a commercial-use subscription which costs
US$250/year/project.
