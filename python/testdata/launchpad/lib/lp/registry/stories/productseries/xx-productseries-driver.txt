Appointing a Product Series Driver (release manager)
====================================================

Sample Person is the driver of Firefox 1.0 series because he is also
the project owner. He can delegate the responsibility of release manager
by appointing someone else as the driver.

    >>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/firefox/1.0')
    >>> content  = find_tag_by_id(browser.contents, 'series-details')
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(content, 'series-drivers'))
    Project drivers: Sample Person
    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(content, 'series-release-manager'))
    Release manager: None Appoint release manager

    >>> browser.getLink('Appoint release manager').click()

    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/firefox/1.0/+driver'
    >>> print browser.title
    Appoint the release manager for...
    >>> browser.getControl('Release manager').value
    ''

    >>> browser.getControl('Release manager').value = 'salgado'
    >>> browser.getControl('Change').click()

After changing the driver, the browser shows the overview page where a
message explains that the driver changed.

    >>> browser.url
    'http://launchpad.dev/firefox/1.0'

    >>> for tag in find_tags_by_class(browser.contents, 'informational'):
    ...     tag.renderContents()
    'Successfully changed the release manager to Guilherme Salgado'

    >>> print extract_text(find_tag_by_id(content, 'series-drivers'))
