Convert bug to question
=======================

Some bugs that are filed, aren't really bugs, they are questions. When
the bug target's pillar uses Launchpad to track bugs, the bug can be
converted to a question. The process creates a new question using the
bug's owner, title, and description. The bug's status is set to Invalid
in every location that it affects.

A user with permission to edit a bug may create a question from a bug.
An anonymous user cannot create a question.

    >>> anon_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev'
    ...     '/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/10')
    >>> anon_browser.title
    'Bug #10 ... : Bugs : ...linux-source-2.6.15... package : Ubuntu'

    >>> anon_browser.getLink('Convert to a question').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):

No Privileges Person is doing triage for Ubuntu. He recognizes bug 10 is
really a question. He chooses to make a question from it.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev'
    ...     '/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/10')
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #10 ... : Bugs : ...linux-source-2.6.15... package : Ubuntu'

    >>> user_browser.getLink('Convert to a question').click()
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Convert this bug to a question...

The 'Convert this to a question' page explains what will happen if No
Privileges Person chooses to make the bug into a question. There is a
field for a comment. He decides to create the question using the
'Convert this bug to a question' button.

    >>> find_main_content(user_browser.contents).p
    <p>... the bug's status is set to Invalid. The new question
    will be linked to the bug. ...

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Comment').value = 'This bug is a question.'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Convert this Bug into a Question').click()

No Privileges Person is shown the bug page again. There is a permanent
informational message stating that a question was created from the bug.

    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #10 ... : Bugs : ...linux-source-2.6.15... package : Ubuntu'

    >>> content = find_main_content(user_browser.contents)
    >>> content.find(id="bug-is-question")
    <p...This bug report was converted into a question:
     question #...: <a ...>another test bug</a>. </p>

The bug status is Invalid for 'linux-source-2.6.15 (Ubuntu)'--It cannot
be edited.

    >>> print extract_text(content(['table'], {'class' : 'listing'})[0])
    Affects                        Status   Importance  Assigned to  Milestone

bugtask directly.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev'
    ...     '/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/10/+editstatus')
    >>> print_feedback_messages(user_browser.contents)

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tags_by_class(str(content), 'boardCommentBody')[-1])
    This bug is a question.

No Privileges Person looks at the page heading and sees that Foo Bar is
the bug owner. He sees the link to the question in the 'Related
questions' portlet, and uses it to go to the question page.

    >>> print user_browser.url
    http://bugs.launchpad.dev/ubuntu/.../+bug/10

    >>> portlet = find_portlet(user_browser.contents, 'Related questions')
    >>> question_anchor = portlet.a
    >>> question_anchor
    <a href=".../ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+question/...">another
    test bug</a>

    >>> user_browser.getLink('another test bug').click()

No Privileges Person case see that the question was created from a bug.
He uses the link to Related bug to return to the bug.

    >>> print user_browser.title
    Question #... : Questions : ...linux-source-2.6.15... package : Ubuntu

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'original-bug'))
    This question was originally filed as bug #10.

    >>> user_browser.getLink('#10: another test bug').click()
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #10 ... : Bugs : ...linux-source-2.6.15... package : Ubuntu'


When a question cannot be created from a bug
---------------------------------------------

Thunderbird does not use Launchpad to track bugs. Questions cannot be
made from its bugs. When No Privileges Person uses the link in the Bug
Actions menu, the page explains why he cannot make the bug into a
question.

    >>> user_browser.open('http://bugs.launchpad.dev/thunderbird/+bug/9')
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #9 ...'

    >>> user_browser.getLink('Convert to a question').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Convert this bug to a question...

    >>> find_main_content(user_browser.contents).p
    <p>
    This bug cannot be converted into a question.
    Mozilla Thunderbird does not use Launchpad to track bugs.
    Mozilla Thunderbird does not use Launchpad for support questions. ...

The page is present, but without a comment field or a button to create
the question.

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Comment')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError: ...

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Convert to a question').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LookupError: ...

If No Privileges Person were to create a question from a bug, then
return to the create a question from a bug page using his back button or
a bookmark, he sees that he cannot create the question again.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev'
    ...     '/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/10/+create-question')
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Convert this bug to a question...

    >>> find_main_content(user_browser.contents).p
    <p>
    This bug cannot be converted into a question.
    A question was already created from this bug. ...

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Convert this Bug into a Question').click()
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    LookupError: ...

Most browsers cache pages. When No Privileges Person uses his his
browser's back button, after creating a question, he is re-shown the
form as it was. He resubmit the form, and is notified that a question
could not be created.

    >>> # Jokosher must enable answers to access questions.
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.app.enums import ServiceUsage
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.product import IProductSet

    >>> login('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> getUtility(IProductSet)['jokosher'].answers_usage = (
    ...     ServiceUsage.LAUNCHPAD)
    >>> transaction.commit()
    >>> logout()

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/jokosher/+bug/12')
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #12 ...'

    >>> user_browser.getLink('Convert to a question').click()
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Comment').value = 'This will succeed.'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Convert this Bug into a Question').click()
    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #12 ...'

    >>> message = find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'bug-is-question')
    >>> print extract_text(message)
    This bug report was converted into a question:...question #16...


Remove the question
-------------------

After a question is created from a bug, the bug's Action menu displays
the 'Convert back to a bug' link. No Privileges Person decides to
reactivate a bug report.

    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #12 ... : Bugs : Jokosher'

    >>> user_browser.getLink('Convert back to a bug').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Bug #12 - Convert this...

The 'Convert back to a bug' page explains what will happen if No
Privileges Person chooses to reactivate the bug. There is an optional
field for a comment. No other input is needed. No Privileges Person uses
the 'Convert back to a bug' button.

    >>> find_main_content(user_browser.contents).p
    <p>... Reactivate this bug report by removing the question created
    from the bug. ...

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Comment').value = 'I misunderstood.'
    >>> user_browser.getControl('Convert Back to Bug').click()

No Privileges Person is shown the bug page again. There is a notice
stating that a question was removed from the bug. The Related Questions
portlet is gone too. He views the question and sees that it is still in
the Open status.

    >>> user_browser.title
    'Bug #12 ... : Bugs : Jokosher'

    >>> print_feedback_messages(user_browser.contents)
    Removed Question #...:
    Copy, Cut and Delete operations should work...

    >>> portlet = find_portlet(user_browser.contents, 'Related questions')
    >>> print portlet
    None

    >>> user_browser.getLink(
    ...     'Copy, Cut and Delete operations should work on '
    ...     'selections').click()
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Question #... : Questions : Jokosher

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tag_by_id(user_browser.contents, 'question-status'))
    Status: Open

No Privileges Person uses his browser's back button to view the bug
again. The bug status is sill Invalid for Jokosher, but he can edit it.

    >>> user_browser.goBack(count=1)
    >>> content = find_main_content(user_browser.contents)
    >>> print extract_text(content(['table'], {'class' : 'listing'})[0])
    Affects                       Status   Importance  Assigned to  Milestone

    >>> print extract_text(
    ...     find_tags_by_class(str(content), 'boardComment')[-1])
    No Privileges Person (no-priv)
    wrote
    ...
    I misunderstood.
    ...

When the remove question page is visited, and there is no question, the
form is not displayed. This can happened if the URL is hacked or the
question was removed, and the user used his back button to return to the
page. No Privileges Person sees a message that there is no question to
remove.

    >>> user_browser.open(
    ...     'http://bugs.launchpad.dev/jokosher/+bug/12/+remove-question')
    >>> print user_browser.title
    Bug #12 - Convert this...

    >>> find_main_content(user_browser.contents).p
    <p>
    The bug was not converted to a question. There is nothing to change. ...

    LookupError: ...

    >>> user_browser.getControl('Convert Back to Bug').click()
