Hello %(user_displayname)s,

The commercial subscription for project '%(product_name)s' in
Launchpad has expired.
%(commercial_use_expiration)s

'%(product_name)s' was deactivated because its licence is
Other/Proprietary and requires a commercial subscription to use
Launchpad's services. If you wish to reactivate the project contact us
at commercial@launchpad.net to discuss your options.

A commercial subscription allows you to host your commercial project
on Launchpad in the same way as any other project. Project's with a
commercial subscription may have private-by-default bugs, and you
may also request the setup of private code hosting.

As the maintainer of a project with a commercial subscription, you
may create private teams with private mailing lists and private package
archives. Find out more about this here:

Launchpad is a collaboration site, free to use for projects with an
approved open source licence.  When you registered your project, you'd
have seen a list of licences presented. These are the licences we
automatically recognise.

If you have a different licence to one on the approved list, it must
follow the guidelines we list on the following page in order to be
approved: https://help.launchpad.net/Legal/ProjectLicensing

Further information is on our FAQ "Can closed-source or proprietary
projects use Launchpad?" The link is here:

If the licence for your project needs to be corrected, you can do this
by following the 'Change Details' link on your project's overview page.

Thanks,

The Launchpad team.
