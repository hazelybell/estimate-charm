Getting remote products from SourceForge projects
=================================================

Launchpad Products can be linked to SourceForge projects by setting
their 'sourceforgeproject' attribute.

It's possible to get a list of the Products that are linked to a
SourceForge project but which have no remote_product set by calling
IProductSet.getSFLinkedProductsWithNoneRemoteProduct().

There are currently no Products in the database linked to a SourceForge
project without a remote_product set.

    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.product import IProductSet
    >>> products = getUtility(
    ...     IProductSet).getSFLinkedProductsWithNoneRemoteProduct()

    >>> print products.count()
    0

If we add a Product and link it to a SourceForge project,
getSFLinkedProductsWithNoneRemoteProduct() will return it.

    >>> from lp.testing.factory import LaunchpadObjectFactory
    >>> from transaction import commit
    >>> factory = LaunchpadObjectFactory()

    >>> product_1 = factory.makeProduct(name='my-first-product')
    >>> product_1.sourceforgeproject = 'fronobulator'
    >>> commit()

    >>> products = getUtility(
    ...     IProductSet).getSFLinkedProductsWithNoneRemoteProduct()

    >>> for product in products:
    ...     print product.name, product.sourceforgeproject
    my-first-product fronobulator

We'll use a test version of SourceForgeRemoteProductFinder that won't
try to access SourceForge.

    >>> from lp.services.log.logger import FakeLogger
    >>> from lp.bugs.tests.sfremoteproductfinder import (
    ...     TestSFRemoteProductFinder)
    >>> from lp.testing.layers import LaunchpadZopelessLayer
    >>> finder = TestSFRemoteProductFinder(
    ...     txn=LaunchpadZopelessLayer.txn, logger=FakeLogger())

SourceForgeRemoteProductFinder has a method,
getRemoteProductFromSourceForge(), which does all the heavy lifting of finding
the bug tracker for a given SourceForge project. It does this by fetching the
SourceForge project page about each of them. It then finds the link to the
project's 'Tracker' index within that page and follows it. Finally, it
extracts the URL of the project's bug tracker and returns the group_id and
atid therein as an ampersand-separated string.

    >>> remote_product = finder.getRemoteProductFromSourceForge(
    ...     'fronobulator')
    DEBUG...Getting page projects/fronobulator
    DEBUG...Getting page tracker/?group_id=5570

    >>> print remote_product
    5570&105570

If an error is raised when trying to fetch the project pages from the
remote server, it will be logged.

    >>> from lp.bugs.tests.sfremoteproductfinder import (
    ...     TestBrokenSFRemoteProductFinder)
    >>> broken_finder = TestBrokenSFRemoteProductFinder(
    ...     txn=LaunchpadZopelessLayer.txn, logger=FakeLogger())
    >>> broken_finder.getRemoteProductFromSourceForge('fronobulator')
    ERROR...Error fetching project...: HTTP Error 500: This is an error

SourceForgeRemoteProductFinder.setRemoteProductsFromSourceForge()
iterates over the list of products returned by
getSFLinkedProductsWithNoneRemoteProduct() and then calls
getRemoteProductFromSourceForge() to fetch their remote products.

    >>> finder.setRemoteProductsFromSourceForge()
    INFO...Updating 1 Products using SourceForge project data
    DEBUG...Updating remote_product for Product 'my-first-product'
    DEBUG...Getting page projects/fronobulator
    DEBUG...Getting page tracker/?group_id=5570

The product that was linked to SourceForge without a remote_product now has
its remote_product set.

    >>> product_1 = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('my-first-product')
    >>> print product_1.remote_product
    5570&105570

There are no other SourceForge-linked products that have no remote product.

    >>> products = getUtility(
    ...     IProductSet).getSFLinkedProductsWithNoneRemoteProduct()

    >>> print products.count()
    0


update-sourceforge-remote-products.py
-------------------------------------

There is a cronscript, update-sourceforge-remote-products.py, which will use
the SourceForgeRemoteProductFinder to periodically update Products'
remote_product fields.

    >>> import subprocess
    >>> process = subprocess.Popen(
    ...     ['cronscripts/update-sourceforge-remote-products.py', '-v'],
    ...     stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    ...     stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    >>> (out, err) = process.communicate()
    >>> out
    ''
    >>> process.returncode
    0

    >>> print err
    DEBUG   ...
    INFO    No Products to update.
    INFO    Time for this run: ... seconds.
    DEBUG   updateremoteproduct ran in ...s (excl. load & lock)
