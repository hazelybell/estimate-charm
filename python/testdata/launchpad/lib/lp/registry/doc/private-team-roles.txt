Private team participation
==========================

Public teams can perform any role in Launchpad.  Private teams
have some restrictions in the roles they can perform.

Bugs
====

Bug subscriptions
-----------------

    >>> # Create the necessary teams.
    >>> team_owner = factory.makePerson(name='team-owner')
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import (
    ...     IPersonSet,
    ...     PersonVisibility,
    ...     TeamMembershipPolicy,
    ...     )
    >>> admin_user = getUtility(IPersonSet).getByEmail('admin@canonical.com')
    >>> ignored = login_person(admin_user)
    >>> priv_team = factory.makeTeam(name='private-team',
    ...     owner=team_owner,
    ...     visibility=PersonVisibility.PRIVATE,
    ...     membership_policy=TeamMembershipPolicy.RESTRICTED)

A private team can be subscribed to a bug.

    >>> bug = factory.makeBug()
    >>> priv_subscription = bug.subscribe(priv_team, team_owner)

A private team can subscribe others to a bug (the `subscribed_by`
person).

    >>> priv_subscription = bug.subscribe(team_owner, priv_team)

The same team can also unsubscribe the person.

    >>> bug.unsubscribe(team_owner, priv_team)

Only the person can unsubscribe him or her self.

    >>> priv_subscription = bug.subscribe(team_owner, priv_team)
    >>> bug.unsubscribe(team_owner, team_owner)


Bug task assignee
-----------------

A private team can be the assignee for a bug task.

    >>> bugtask = bug.default_bugtask
    >>> bugtask.transitionToAssignee(priv_team)
    >>> print bugtask.assignee.name
    private-team

Branches
========

Branch ownership
----------------

Private teams can be assigned as the owner of a branch

    >>> branch = factory.makeBranch()
    >>> branch.setOwner(priv_team, user=admin_user)

Branch subscriptions
--------------------

Private teams can subscribe to branches.

    >>> from lp.code.enums import (
    ...     BranchSubscriptionDiffSize,
    ...     BranchSubscriptionNotificationLevel,
    ...     CodeReviewNotificationLevel)
    >>> branch = factory.makeBranch()
    >>> subscription = branch.subscribe(
    ...     priv_team,
    ...     BranchSubscriptionNotificationLevel.DIFFSONLY,
    ...     BranchSubscriptionDiffSize.WHOLEDIFF,
    ...     CodeReviewNotificationLevel.STATUS, team_owner)
    >>> print subscription.person.name
    private-team


PPAs
====


PPA ownership
-------------

Private teams can own PPAs.

    >>> from lp.soyuz.enums import ArchivePurpose
    >>> from lp.soyuz.interfaces.archive import IArchiveSet
    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.distribution import (
    ...     IDistributionSet)
    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet)['ubuntu']
    >>> archive_set = getUtility(IArchiveSet)
    >>> private_archive = archive_set.new(
    ...     owner=priv_team, purpose=ArchivePurpose.PPA,
    ...     distribution=ubuntu, name='private-team-archive',
    ...     require_virtualized=False)


PPA subscriptions
-----------------

Private teams can be subscribed to private PPAs.

    >>> login('foo.bar@canonical.com')
    >>> another_priv_team = factory.makeTeam(name='another-private-team',
    ...     owner=team_owner,
    ...     visibility=PersonVisibility.PRIVATE)

    >>> # We must login as the archive owner to add the subscription.
    >>> ignored = login_person(team_owner)
    >>> subscription = private_archive.newSubscription(
    ...     subscriber=another_priv_team,
    ...     registrant=team_owner)
    >>> transaction.commit()


Structural Subscriptions
========================

Structural Subscription to Products
-----------------------------------

Private teams can have structural subscriptions to products.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.product import IProductSet
    >>> firefox = getUtility(IProductSet).getByName('firefox')
    >>> sub = firefox.addSubscription(
    ...     subscriber=priv_team, subscribed_by=team_owner)
    >>> sub.target
    <Product at ...>


Structural Subscription to Distributions
----------------------------------------

Private teams can have structural subscriptions to distros.

    >>> ubuntu = getUtility(IDistributionSet).getByName("ubuntu")
    >>> sub = ubuntu.addSubscription(
    ...     subscriber=priv_team, subscribed_by=team_owner)
    >>> sub.target
    <Distribution 'Ubuntu' (ubuntu)>


Project Roles
=============


Registrant
----------

Only a person can register a project, not a team, so no team, public
or private, can be the project registrant.

    >>> ignored = login_person(admin_user)
    >>> public_team = factory.makeTeam(name='public-team',
    ...     owner=team_owner,
    ...     visibility=PersonVisibility.PUBLIC,
    ...     membership_policy=TeamMembershipPolicy.RESTRICTED)
    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(registrant=team_owner)
    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(registrant=public_team)
    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(registrant=priv_team)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    PrivatePersonLinkageError: Cannot link person
    (name=private-team, visibility=PRIVATE) to
    <Product at...


Maintainer/Owner
----------------

A public team and a private team can be a project owner.

    >>> # The registrant must be specified or it will default to the owner.
    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(registrant=admin_user)
    >>> product.owner = public_team
    >>> product.owner = priv_team

Driver
------

A public team and a private team can be a project driver.

    >>> product = factory.makeProduct()
    >>> product.driver = priv_team

Bug Supervisor
--------------

A public team and a private team can be a project bug supervisor.

    >>> product = factory.makeProduct()
    >>> product.bug_supervisor = public_team
    >>> product.bug_supervisor = priv_team


Product Series Roles
====================


Owner
-----

A public team and a private team can be a product series owner.

    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(registrant=admin_user,
    ...                               owner=public_team)
    >>> product_series = factory.makeProductSeries(product, owner=public_team)
    >>> product_series = factory.makeProductSeries(product, owner=priv_team)


Driver
------

A public team and a private team can be a product series driver.

    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(registrant=admin_user,
    ...                               owner=public_team)
    >>> product_series = factory.makeProductSeries(product, owner=public_team)
    >>> product_series.driver = public_team
    >>> product_series.driver = priv_team


Product Release Roles
=====================

Owner
-----

A public team and a private team can be a product series owner.

    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(registrant=admin_user,
    ...                               owner=public_team)
    >>> product_series = factory.makeProductSeries(product, owner=public_team)
    >>> product_milestone = factory.makeMilestone(
    ...     product=product, productseries=product_series)
    >>> product_release = factory.makeProductRelease(
    ...     product=product, milestone=product_milestone)
    >>> product_release.owner = public_team
    >>> product_release.owner = priv_team

Some artifacts of a product change ownership when the product owner
changes.  The artifacts are product series, product release, and
translation import queue entries.

    >>> product = factory.makeProduct(registrant=admin_user)
    >>> product_series = factory.makeProductSeries(
    ...     product=product, owner=public_team)
    >>> product_release = factory.makeProductRelease(product=product)
    >>> from lp.translations.interfaces.translationimportqueue import (
    ...     ITranslationImportQueue)
    >>> import_queue = getUtility(ITranslationImportQueue)
    >>> entry = import_queue.addOrUpdateEntry(
    ...     u'po/sr.po', 'foo', True, public_team,
    ...      productseries=product_series)
    >>> product.owner = public_team
    >>> product.owner = priv_team


Team Membership
===============

Mixing public and private teams can create interesting situations.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import PrivatePersonLinkageError
    >>> reviewer = factory.makePerson()
    >>> def join_team(joined_type, joiner_type):
    ...     joined = factory.makeTeam(owner=team_owner,
    ...                               visibility=joined_type)
    ...     joiner = factory.makeTeam(owner=team_owner,
    ...                               visibility=joiner_type)
    ...     print "%s <- %s: " % (joined_type, joiner_type),
    ...     try:
    ...         joined.addMember(joiner, reviewer=reviewer)
    ...     except PrivatePersonLinkageError:
    ...         print "Not Allowed"
    ...     else:
    ...         print "Allowed"

    >>> public = PersonVisibility.PUBLIC
    >>> private = PersonVisibility.PRIVATE

    >>> visibility_list = list(PersonVisibility.items)

    >>> for joined in visibility_list:
    ...     for joiner in visibility_list:
    ...         join_team(joined, joiner)
    ...     print "---"
    Public <- Public:  Allowed
    Public <- Private: Allowed
    ---
    Private <- Public:  Allowed
    Private <- Private: Allowed
    ---
