INotificationRecipientSet
=========================

It is part of Launchpad policy that all email notifications contain in
the footer an explanation of why the email was sent. A simpler string is
also usually added to a X-Launchpad-Message-Rationale header to allow
easy filtering.

The easiest way to implement that policy is for methods returning a list
of subscribers or other kind of recipients list to return an object
providing INotificationRecipientSet. That interface encapsulates the
recipient lists with the rationale for contacting them.

There is a base implementation of the interface available as
lp.services.mail.notificationrecipientset.NotificationRecipientSet. You can
use it as is or derive from it (see bugnotificationrecipients.txt for an
example of a derivation).

    >>> from lp.services.mail.interfaces import INotificationRecipientSet
    >>> from lp.testing import verifyObject
    >>> from lp.services.mail.notificationrecipientset import (
    ...     NotificationRecipientSet)

    >>> recipients = NotificationRecipientSet()
    >>> verifyObject(INotificationRecipientSet, recipients)
    True


Populating the set
------------------

You add recipients to the set using the add() method. The method takes
the IPerson to add along the notification rationale and header code.

    >>> from lp.registry.interfaces.person import IPersonSet
    >>> person_set = getUtility(IPersonSet)
    >>> sample_person = person_set.getByEmail('test@canonical.com')
    >>> cprov = person_set.getByName('cprov')

    >>> recipients.add(
    ...     sample_person, 'You are notified because...', 'Unknown')
    >>> recipients.add(cprov, 'You are notified for no reason.', 'Why not')

The current list of header values in use can be found at
https://help.launchpad.net/LaunchpadMessageRationale. The 'Why not'
value is only used as an example. In practice, you should try to reuse
existing values if they apply to your context.

The getPersons() method returns the list of recipients sorted by display
name.

    >>> [person.displayname for person in recipients.getRecipients()]
    [u'Celso Providelo', u'Sample Person']

It's also possible to iterate over the recipients:

    >>> for person in recipients:
    ...     print person.displayname
    Celso Providelo
    Sample Person

The getEmails() methods return the emails of all the recipients, also
sorted alphabetically:

    >>> recipients.getEmails()
    ['celso.providelo@canonical.com', 'test@canonical.com']

You can test if an IPerson or an email is part of the recipients using
the standard `in` operator:

    >>> cprov in recipients
    True

    >>> 'celso.providelo@canonical.com' in recipients
    True

    >>> u'test@canonical.com' in recipients
    True

    >>> no_priv = person_set.getByName('no-priv')
    >>> no_priv in recipients
    False

An recipient set containing recipients evaluates to True:

    >>> bool(recipients)
    True

An empty recipient set, evaluates to False:

    >>> bool(NotificationRecipientSet())
    False


Obtaining the rationale
-----------------------

You can obtain the rationale, header tuple by using the getReason()
method:

    >>> recipients.getReason(cprov)
    ('You are notified for no reason.', 'Why not')

You can also ask the reason associated with an email address:

    >>> recipients.getReason('test@canonical.com')
    ('You are notified because...', 'Unknown')

Requesting the reason for somebody that is not a recipient raises a
UnknownRecipientError:

    >>> recipients.getReason(no_priv)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    UnknownRecipientError: ...

    >>> recipients.getReason('no-priv@canonical.com')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    UnknownRecipientError: 'no-priv@canonical.com'

Passing something else than an IPerson or a string is forbidden:

    >>> recipients.getReason(1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    AssertionError: ...


Team as recipient
-----------------

Adding a team with a preferred email address works like adding any other
person:

    >>> ubuntu_team = person_set.getByName('ubuntu-team')
    >>> ignored = login_person(ubuntu_team.teamowner)
    >>> print ubuntu_team.preferredemail.email
    support@ubuntu.com

    >>> recipients.add(ubuntu_team, 'You are notified for fun.', 'Fun')

    >>> ubuntu_team in recipients
    True

    >>> 'support@ubuntu.com' in recipients
    True

    >>> [person.displayname for person in recipients]
    [u'Celso Providelo', u'Sample Person', u'Ubuntu Team']

    >>> recipients.getEmails()
    ['celso.providelo@canonical.com', 'support@ubuntu.com',
     'test@canonical.com']

But when a team doesn't have an email address, the team members email
addresses are added to the recipients list, and this recursively.

    >>> recipients = NotificationRecipientSet()
    >>> ubuntu_gnome_team = person_set.getByName('name18')
    >>> print ubuntu_gnome_team.preferredemail
    None

    >>> recipients.add(
    ...     ubuntu_gnome_team,
    ...     'Notified because a member of the team', 'Team')
    >>> ubuntu_gnome_team in recipients
    True

    >>> recipients.getEmails()
    ['andrew.bennetts@ubuntulinux.com', 'foo.bar@canonical.com',
     'limi@plone.org', 'steve.alexander@ubuntulinux.com',
     'test@canonical.com']

But looking at the recipients list, only the team is listed:

    >>> [person.displayname for person in recipients]
    [u'Ubuntu Gnome Team']

So Sample Person is not in the recipients list, even if his email will
be notified for he's a member of Warty Security Team, itself a member of
Ubuntu Gnome Team:

    >>> warty_security_team = person_set.getByName('name20')
    >>> print warty_security_team.displayname
    Warty Security Team

    >>> sample_person.inTeam(warty_security_team)
    True

    >>> warty_security_team.inTeam(ubuntu_gnome_team)
    True

    >>> sample_person in ubuntu_gnome_team.activemembers
    False

    >>> sample_person in recipients
    False

    >>> 'test@canonical.com' in recipients
    True

His email will have the same rationale than the team:

    >>> recipients.getReason(ubuntu_gnome_team)
    ('Notified because a member of the team', 'Team')

    >>> recipients.getReason('test@canonical.com')
    ('Notified because a member of the team', 'Team')


Adding many persons at the same time
------------------------------------

If you pass an iterable sequence to the add() method, all members will
be added with the same rationale:

    >>> recipients = NotificationRecipientSet()
    >>> recipients.add(
    ...     [sample_person, no_priv], 'Notified for fun.', 'Fun')
    >>> [person.displayname for person in recipients.getRecipients()]
    [u'No Privileges Person', u'Sample Person']

    >>> recipients.getReason(no_priv)
    ('Notified for fun.', 'Fun')

    >>> recipients.getReason(sample_person)
    ('Notified for fun.', 'Fun')


Removing recipients
-------------------

It is also possible to remove a person from the
NotificationRecipientSet():

    >>> recipients = NotificationRecipientSet()
    >>> recipients.add(
    ...     [sample_person, no_priv, cprov], 'Notified for fun.', 'Fun')
    >>> [person.displayname for person in recipients.getRecipients()]
    [u'Celso Providelo', u'No Privileges Person', u'Sample Person']

    >>> recipients.remove([sample_person, cprov])
    >>> [person.displayname for person in recipients.getRecipients()]
    [u'No Privileges Person']

    >>> recipients.getEmails()
    ['no-priv@canonical.com']


A person's first impression sticks
----------------------------------

In general, the most specific rationale is used for a given email. A
rationale given for a person is considered more specific than one
obtained through team membership.

So, if a person is added more than once to the set, the first reason
will be the one returned.

    >>> recipients = NotificationRecipientSet()
    >>> recipients.add(sample_person, 'A good reason', 'Good')
    >>> recipients.add(sample_person, 'Not a good reason', 'No good')

    >>> recipients.getReason(sample_person)
    ('A good reason', 'Good')

But if a person already had a rationale added through a team, the
rationale specific to the person is used:

    >>> recipients = NotificationRecipientSet()
    >>> recipients.add(
    ...     warty_security_team, 'Because you are a member of team',
    ...     'Team')
    >>> recipients.add(sample_person, 'A more specific reason', 'Specific')

    >>> recipients.getReason('test@canonical.com')
    ('A more specific reason', 'Specific')

Adding a rationale for another team won't override the one for the first
one:

    >>> recipients = NotificationRecipientSet()
    >>> recipients.add(
    ...     warty_security_team, 'Member of Warty', 'Warty')
    >>> recipients.add(
    ...     ubuntu_gnome_team, 'Member of Ubuntu Gnome', 'Ubuntu Gnome')
    >>> recipients.getReason('test@canonical.com')
    ('Member of Warty', 'Warty')

Nor adding a team rationale, when there is already one for the person:

    >>> recipients = NotificationRecipientSet()
    >>> recipients.add(sample_person, 'Sample Person', 'Person')
    >>> recipients.add(
    ...     warty_security_team, 'Member of Warty.', 'Team')
    >>> recipients.getReason('test@canonical.com')
    ('Sample Person', 'Person')


Merging recipients set
----------------------

You can merge two recipients set by using the update() method. It will
add all the recipients in the second set along their rationale. If the
recipient is already part of the first set, the reason won't be updated.

    >>> recipients = NotificationRecipientSet()
    >>> recipients.add(sample_person, 'Reason A', 'A')
    >>> other_recipients = NotificationRecipientSet()
    >>> other_recipients.add([sample_person, cprov, no_priv], 'Reason B', 'B')

    >>> recipients.update(other_recipients)
    >>> for person in recipients:
    ...     reason, code = recipients.getReason(person)
    ...     print '%s: %s (%s)' % (person.displayname, code, reason)
    Celso Providelo: B (Reason B)
    No Privileges Person: B (Reason B)
    Sample Person: A (Reason A)
