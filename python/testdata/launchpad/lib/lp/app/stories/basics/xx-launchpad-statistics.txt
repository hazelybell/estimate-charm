We also have the special Launchpad Statistics summary page. This is only
acessible to launchpad Admins:

  >>> user_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+statistics')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
  Unauthorized:...


When we login as an admin, we can see all the stats listed:

  >>> admin_browser.open('http://launchpad.dev/+statistics/')
  >>> print admin_browser.title
  Launchpad statistics
  >>> 'answered_question_count' in admin_browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'products_with_blueprints' in admin_browser.contents
  True
  >>> 'solved_question_count' in admin_browser.contents
  True
