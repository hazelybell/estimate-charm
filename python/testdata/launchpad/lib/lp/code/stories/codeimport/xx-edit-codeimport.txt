= Editing code import details =

Not everyone can edit code import details, these stories show what it's like
to edit a code import if you are the owner of the code import branch.

The code import details are displayed on the main branch page for imported
branches. If the logged-in user is allowed to edit the code import then they
can see a link to edit the details.

    >>> from lp.testing import ANONYMOUS, login, logout
    >>> from lp.services.webapp import canonical_url

    >>> login(ANONYMOUS)
    >>> registrant = factory.makePerson()
    >>> svn_import = factory.makeProductCodeImport(
    ...     svn_branch_url='svn://svn.example.com/fooix/trunk',
    ...     registrant=registrant)
    >>> svn_import_location = str(canonical_url(svn_import.branch))
    >>> svn_import_branch_unique_name = svn_import.branch.unique_name

    >>> hosted_branch = factory.makeAnyBranch()
    >>> hosted_branch_location = str(canonical_url(hosted_branch))

    # Must remove the security proxy because IEmailAddress.email is protected.
    >>> from zope.security.proxy import removeSecurityProxy
    >>> email = removeSecurityProxy(registrant.preferredemail).email
    >>> import_browser = setupBrowser(auth='Basic %s:test' % str(email))
    >>> logout()


== Import details on the branch page ==

Imported branches have a section with the title "Import details".
In this section the review state of the import is shown, along with
the location of the import.

People that are not VCS Imports members, nor Launchpad administrators
do not get an Edit link.

    >>> def print_import_details(browser):
    ...     div = find_tag_by_id(
    ...         browser.contents, 'branch-import-details').div.div
    ...     print extract_text(div)
    >>> anon_browser.open(svn_import_location)
    >>> print_import_details(anon_browser)
    Import Status: Reviewed
    This branch is an import of the Subversion branch
    from svn://svn.example.com/fooix/trunk.
    The next import is scheduled to run
    as soon as possible.

Because it's an svn:// URL, it doesn't get linkified:

    >>> anon_browser.getLink("svn://svn.example.com/fooix/trunk")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    LinkNotFoundError


== Not authorized versus 404 ==

If the user attempts to hack the URL to edit the import details,
they will get a not authorised page if the branch has a code import,
and a 404 if the branch doesn't have an import.

    >>> anon_browser.open(svn_import_location + '/+edit-import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    Unauthorized: (... 'launchpad.Edit')

    >>> admin_browser.open(hosted_branch_location + '/+edit-import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    NotFoundError


== Editing details ==

    >>> import_browser.open(svn_import_location)
    >>> import_browser.getLink('Edit import source or review import')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    LinkNotFoundError


== Import details for a import that has been imported successfully ==

If a branch has been successfully imported in the past, then the date
that it was last successful is shown, as well as when the next import
will be run -- which is, by default for Subversion, six hours after the
last import completed, and so in this case in about three hours.

We log in as "david.allouche" since he has super-user privileges for code
imports.

    >>> login('david.allouche@canonical.com')
    >>> from lp.code.tests.codeimporthelpers import (
    ...     make_finished_import, get_import_for_branch_name)
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> import pytz
    >>> date_finished = datetime(2007, 9, 10, 12, tzinfo=pytz.UTC)
    >>> code_import = get_import_for_branch_name(
    ...     svn_import_branch_unique_name)
    >>> code_import = make_finished_import(code_import, factory=factory,
    ...                                    date_finished=date_finished)
    >>> logout()

    >>> import_browser.open(svn_import_location)
    >>> print_import_details(import_browser)
    Import Status: Reviewed

    ...


== Requesting an import ==

If an import is waiting for its next update, any logged in user can
click a button to request an immediate import.

    >>> sample_person_browser = setupBrowser(
    ...     auth='Basic test@canonical.com:test')
    >>> sample_person_browser.open(import_browser.url)
    >>> sample_person_browser.getControl('Import Now')
    <SubmitControl ...>

Anonymous users cannot see this button.

    >>> anon_browser.open(import_browser.url)
    >>> anon_browser.getControl('Import Now')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    LookupError: label 'Import Now'

If the logged in user clicks this button, the import will be scheduled
to run ASAP and the fact that the import has been requested is
displayed.

    >>> sample_person_browser.getControl('Import Now').click()
    >>> print_feedback_messages(sample_person_browser.contents)
    Import will run as soon as possible.
    >>> print_import_details(sample_person_browser)
    Import Status: Reviewed
    This branch is an import of the Subversion branch from
        svn://svn.example.com/fooix/trunk.
    The next import is scheduled to run as soon as possible (requested
    by Sample Person).
    Last successful import was on 2007-09-10.
    ...


== Deleting an import ==

If you own the branch that has the code import, you can delete the branch.

    >>> import_browser.getLink('Delete branch').click()
    >>> import_browser.getControl('Delete').click()
    >>> print_feedback_messages(import_browser.contents)
    Branch ... deleted.
