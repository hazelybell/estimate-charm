Overview
--------

Launchpad's bug tracker sends you email about the bugs you're
interested in. If you see something that requires your
attention - for example, you want to comment on a bug - rather
than leaving your email client to fire up a web browser, all you
need to do is reply to the email.

It's not just limited to replying to bug notifications, though.
The bug tracker's email interface allows you to do just about
everything you can in the web interface. Within time, you may
find that email is the main way you interact with the bug
tracker.


Before you start
----------------

Launchpad only accepts email that is GPG signed. Read our guide
on adding your GPG key to your Launchpad account for more info:

https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/ImportingYourPGPKey


Anatomy of an email to the bug tracker
--------------------------------------

Let's look at the elements of a bug report email:

 * From address: the address from which you send the email must
   be registered in your Launchpad account -
   https://launchpad.net/people/+me/+editemails
 * To address: "new@bugs.launchpad.net" to report a new bug,
   "bugnumber@bugs.launchpad.net" to manipulate an existing bug
   report or for bulk edits "edit@bugs.launchpad.net"
 * Subject: Launchpad uses this as the bug report or comment
   summary.
 * Email body: the text of your email forms the bug report or
   comment detail. This is also where you can supply commands to
   manipulate the bug.

That last item, the email body, needs a little more explanation.
When you want to use one of the email interface's commands, you
need to start the line with a space. Everything else is treated
as part of your bug report or comment detail.


Getting started with the email interface
----------------------------------------

Let's take a look at an imaginary scenario, in which someone
reports a bug requesting a screen cast to help demonstrate the
bug tracker's email interface.


Reporting a bug
---------------

Reporting a new bug by email is simple. Send an email to
new@bugs.launchpad.net and describe the problem you're having.
Tell Launchpad which project, distribution or distribution
package the bug affects by using the "affects" command.

Important: "affects" must be the first command you give in the
email when reporting a new bug.

Here's an example bug report email:

From: you@example.com
To: new@bugs.launchpad.net
Subject: Bug tracker email interface needs a screen cast

Body:

I looked on the Launchpad help wiki for information on using the
bug tracker's email interface. I found the user guide helpful
but wanted a screen cast to demonstrate it at my local LUG.

 affects launchpad-documentation


If the bug affects a distribution package, state the
distribution name followed by a slash and the package name.
For example: "affects ubuntu/firefox".

Similarly, if the bug affects more than onevproject or package,
use a new line for each project/package:

 affects exaile
 affects ubuntu/exaile


Commenting on and changing the status of a bug
----------------------------------------------

If you've received a notification about a bug and you want to
leave a comment, simply reply to the email. Otherwise, to
comment on a bug, send your email to
"bugnumber@bugs.launchpad.net".

For example: "123@bugs.launchpad.net".

Here's an example bug comment email, with a command to change
its status to "Confirmed":

From: joey@canonical.com
To: 123@bugs.launchpad.net
Subject: Neat idea

Body:

What a neat idea! Matt R: can you schedule some time to create a
screen cast?

We should put the screen cast directly in the bug tracker's
interface.

 affects malone
 status confirmed

Joey has also marked the bug as affecting the Launchpad bug
tracker itself, using its project name "malone".


Assigning and targeting the bug
--------------------------------

Matthew sees that his boss, Joey, thinks this a good idea, so he
assigns it to himself and targets it to a future milestone:

From: matthew.revell@canonical.com
To: 123@bugs.launchpad.net
Subject: I'll tackle this in September

Body:

> What a neat idea! Matt R: can you schedule some time to create
  a screen cast?

Yeah, this is a great idea. I'll have time for this in September.

 affects launchpad-documentation
 assignee matthew.revell
 milestone 1.2.9

Note that Matthew used the "affects" command. Earlier, Joey
marked the bug as also affecting another project. Here, "affects"
lets Matthew ensure the assignee and milestone are applied to
the bug as it affects the Launchpad Documentation project.

Matthew could just as easily have left out the "affects" command
and Launchpad would have selected the most likely project that
bug is reported against.


Attaching files to bug reports
------------------------------

Once Matthew's started work on the bug, he can attach an image
from the screen cast to the bug report to show how he's getting
on.

In most cases, file attachments are useful for screen shots that
demonstrate the bug or for log files.

You can attach a file to a bug report by attaching the file to
the email you send to Launchpad.

The attachment must have its content-disposition set to
"attachment" and not "inline". Images pasted into emails in
Mozilla Thunderbird have a content-disposition of "inline", so
attach them rather than paste them into the email body.

To help prevent unwanted files being attached to bug reports,
Launchpad filters files that are unlikely to be intended for the
bug report, including:

 * signatures
 * VCards
 * MacOS resource forks.


Editing a bug that affects multiple contexts
---------------------------------------------

Every package or project affected by a bug has its own fix
status, assignee, milestone and so on. Use the "affects" command
to edit each of these as it affects a particular context.

For example:

From: you@example.com
To: 29760@bugs.launchpad.net
Subject: <none>

 affects ubuntu/flash-player
 status fixreleased

When a bug affects only one package or product, the "affects"
command is unnecessary.


What to expect when you submit an email
----------------------------------------

Launchpad processes incoming bug mail every three minutes, so a
slight delay between sending a mail and receiving a response is
normal.


On success
-----------

If Launchpad processed your email successfully, it will reply by
email to confirm the changes. This email is identical to the bug
notification that would get if you had made the same changes
using the web interface.

For example, if you sent an email like:

From: you@example.com
To: 28919@bugs.launchpad.net
Subject: Re: [Bug 28919] error signing code of conduct: "str:
         No public key"

 status incomplete

You'll receive a response like:


From: you@example.com
To: you@example.com
Subject: [Bug 28919] error signing code of conduct: "str:
         No public key"

Public bug report changed:
https://launchpad.net/malone/bugs/28919

Changed in: Launchpad (upstream)
         Status: Unconfirmed => Incomplete


On failure
-----------

If an error occurs while processing your email, Launchpad will
send you a failure message.

For example, if you forget to GPG-sign an email reporting a new
bug, you'll receive an error message similar to:

From: noreply@bugs.launchpad.net
To: you@example.com
Subject: Submit Request Failure

An error occurred while processing a mail you sent to Malone's
email interface.


Error message:

In order to submit bugs via email you have to sign the message
with a GPG key that is registered in Launchpad.

If you've waited several minutes and still have not received either a
change notification or an error message, ask a question at

Filtering bug mail
-------------------

If you deal with a large number of bug reports by email, you may
find that you want to filter them to stop them cluttering your
in-box. Launchpad appends custom headers to bug emails to help
you filter them.

You can find out more about the headers that Launchpad uses in
our article on bug subscriptions:

https://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/Subscriptions#headers


Commands reference
-------------------

You must write one email command per line.

For example:

 status confirmed
 assignee foobar

You can mix commands with non-command text, such as the
description when filing a bug, or comment text when replying to
a bug notification.

For example:

This is an example bit of bug description.

 affects ubuntu/firefox

And this is some more description.

 assignee bradb


affects
-------

"affects [distribution|package|product]"

When filing a bug, "affects $target" marks the bug as affecting
"$target".

You can also, optionally, use "affects" when you're editing a
bug. For example, if you want to set the status of a bug as it
affects Zope 3, you'd use "affects zope3".

If you leave out "affects", Launchpad will make your changes to
the bug the following context:

 1. the project, distribution or package for which you are a bug
    supervisor
 2. the distribution of which you're a member

If Launchpad can't determine the context in which to make your
changes, it will email you with an error message.

The "affects" target can take the following forms:

 * affects ubuntu/$packagename
 * affects $distroname
 * affects $productname


summary
-------

"summary '$summary'"

Change the one-line summary of the bug. Quotes are required.

 summary 'A better summary'


assignee
--------

"assignee [name|email|nobody]"

Assign a bug to someone:

 assignee bac

or:

 assignee brad.crittenden@canonical.com

Unassign the bug:

 assignee nobody

status
-------

"status [new|incomplete|invalid|wontfix|confirmed|triaged|inprogress|fixcommitted|fixreleased]"

Change the status of a bug:

 status fixreleased


importance

"importance [wishlist|low|medium|high|critical]"

Change the importance of a bug:

 importance high


milestone
---------

"milestone $milestone"

Sets or clears the milestone of the bug. The milestone must
already exist in Launchpad:

 milestone 1.1.10

You can clear the milestone by sending a hyphen:

 milestone -


private
-------

"private [yes|no]"

Changes the visibility of the bug:

 private yes


subscribe
---------

"subscribe [name|email]"

Subscribe yourself or someone else to the bug. If you don't
specify a name or email, Launchpad will subscribe you, the send
of the email, to the bug.

Subscribe yourself to the bug:

 subscribe


Subscribe Foo Bar to the bug:

 subscribe foo.bar@canonical.com


Subscribe the user bjornt to the bug:

 subscribe bjornt


unsubscribe
-----------

"unsubscribe [name|email]"

The opposite of the subscribe command.


duplicate
---------

"duplicate $bugid"

Mark the bug as a duplicate of another bug:

  duplicate 42

To unmark the bug as a duplicate, specify "no" in place of a bug
id:

  duplicate no


bug
---

"bug $bugid"

The "bug"` command is useful if you want to use one email to
make changes to several bugs.

Send such emails to "edit@bugs.launchpad.net"

From: terry.tibbs@tibbsmotors.com
To: edit@bugs.launchpad.net
Subject: <whatever>

 bug 42
 status confirmed

 bug 49
 status confirmed


tag
---

"tag $tag"

Assign a tag to a bug. You can specify multiple tags with a
single command:

 tag foo

Or:

 tag foo bar

Remove a tag by prefixing the tag name with "-":

 tag -foo


done
----

"done" tells Launchpad to process no further commands.

For example:

 tag foo
 status confirmed
 done
 affects everyone using version 1.0.1

The line below "done" looks like an "affects" command but
Launchpad will ignore it.
